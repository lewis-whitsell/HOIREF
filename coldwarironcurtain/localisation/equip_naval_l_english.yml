 submarine_1_desc:0 "Submarines are stealthy vessels designed to take out undefended convoys. The early models from the Great War pave the way for new methods of naval warfare."
 submarine_2_desc:0 "Better armed and more stable, new submarine designs are made to take advantage of advancements in naval tactics and have longer range, being able to attack distant convoy routes."
 submarine_3_desc:0 "The role of the submarine in the fleet outside of convoy attacks is still under debate. Achieving a balance between combination of speed, range and weaponry will be key to the necessary model."
 submarine_4_desc:0 "Increased test depth and efficient layouts will be features of the modern submarines, taking advantage of field experience to select appropriate armaments and engines."

 battleship_2_desc:0 "With improved stability and range, a new generation of battleships improve upon previous designs while remaining within limits stipulated by naval treaties."
 battleship_3_desc:0 "Thicker armor, stronger engines, a battery of high-caliber guns and improved anti-air capabilities can allow battleships to remain relevant, if correctly employed, in a world where naval warfare is increasingly dominated by aerial support."
 battleship_4_desc:0 "As the world sees what may be the last major battleship confrontations, the importance of heavy armaments and anti-air turrets is greater than ever."
