 swe.1.t:0 "Terror in Stockholm!"
 swe.1.d:0 "A terrorist attack was launched in Östermalm, Stockholm earlier today by a radical far-right terrorist organization. They claim that the government has become corrupt and needs a strong authority figure to put Sweden back on the map. Over 20 people were killed in the bombing with dozens more injured outside of an apartment building. This has caused several far right parties to be blamed for the attack, and more people are seen to be supporting the far left parties. This can only be the beginning of a polarization of Sweden."
 swe.1.a:0 "Communists Will Save Us!"
 swe.2.t:0 "Terrorism in Gothenburg!"
 swe.2.d:0 "A Vehicle-ramming attack occured outside of a plaza in Gothenburg as a stolen truck drove into a crowd. Dozens have been reported to been killed, with many more injured. A group supporting the monarchy have claimed responability for the attack, and wish for the Swedish King to intrevene more in state affairs. This has put a blight into the politics of Sweden, and there will be a long road ahead."
 swe.2.a:0 "Maybe they have a point?"
 swedennewsevent.3.d:0 "Sweden today announced that they are demanding the return of the old Dominion of Swedish Pomerania after there has been a recent surge in reclaiming lost Swedish land and nationalism. The Swedish Parliment earlier this week voted on drafting a bill to send to East Germany asking for the return of Swedish Pomerania. Swedish Pomerania was formed back in 1630 following the Polish War and the Thirty Year's War. However, over the next 100 years Swedish Pomerania would slowly lose their land. In 1814, Sweden ceded Swedish Pomerania to Denmark in exchange for Norway in the Treaty of Kiel. Danish Pomerania was then annexed by the Prussian Empire in 1815 after the Congress of Vienna. Since then the land has been occupied by the Germans, but now Sweden is demanding their lost land. We will have to see what happens."
 swedennewsevent.4.d:0 "Sweden today announced that they are demanding the return of Swedish Gold Coast from the British Empire. This comes after Swedish Parliment drafted a treaty due to new nationalism and support for reclaiming lost Swedish land. Swedish Gold Coast was colonized back in 1650 by a series of trading ports. The colony would stay under Swedish rule until 1663 when it was seized by Denmark and integrated into the Danish Gold Coast. The colony would stay under Danish rule until 1850 when it was sold to the British Empire for debt payment. With a rise in wanting to reclaim the lost glory of Sweden, the Swedish are wanting their old colonial empire back. We will have to see what the response is to the treaty."
