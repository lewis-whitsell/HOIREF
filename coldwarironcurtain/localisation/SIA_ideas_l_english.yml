 the_lagacy_of_khana_ratsadon_desc:0 "The Revolution of 1932 Proved to be A Turning Point of Thai Politics. It ended with the absolute reign of the monarchist pover, which lasted for almost 600 Years and gave Thailand its first Constitution. But it didn't End Well. It was followed by a short civil war in 1933. Until today, Thailand remains in political instability and a struggle for Power between Plaek Phibunsongkhram and Pridi Banomyong, who both were the former members of The Khana Ratsadon."
