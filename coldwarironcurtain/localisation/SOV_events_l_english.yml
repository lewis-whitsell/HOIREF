 newssovever.1.d:0 "Nikita Khrushchev has decided to step down as Premier because of advanced age and ill health.  Nikita Khrushchev led the Soviet Union for a decade and started their Space Program, led the Berlin Question, and of course supported Cuba for a Communist government. Nikita Khrushchev said that he wishes the USSR to live on and that Leonid Brezhnev would do a great job as Premier. Other countries around the World has been surprised by this move. What path will the USSR now take under Leonid Brezhnev? Peace or War?"
 newssovever.2.d:0 "Big news has come out of the USSR as Nikita Khrushchev has said that Leonid Brezhnev has tried to remove him as Premier of the USSR. Khrushchev has stated that he has been betrayed by his fellow comrades and that this is high treason. Brezhnev has said that Khrushchev is unfit for Premier due to him almost plunging the World into World War III in 1961 and 1962. He also said that now he wants to be friends with the USA and that he is getting too friendly with them. Both sides have called for supporters and the military to uphold the USSR and defend their rightful leaders. We are looking at a civil war in the USSR soon."
 newssovever.3.d:0 "Word of a coup has spread in the USSR very fast and can only be know to be spread by Nikita Khrushchev or someone betrayed us in the "Committee". Brezhnev and the "Committee" has now been know to the World and we need to do something. We are looking at a very dark time for the USSR. Both sides have called for support and to uphold justice and fight the other side. What side do we join in the fight for Premier? Khrushchev or Brezhnev?"
 every1.9.d:0 "The Mexicans have granted Nikita Khrushchev political asylum to live in a secret location in Mexico. The Mexicans surely signed a deal with Khrushchev so that he would have protection in order for him to give them Soviet secrets and plans about how we operate. The Americans would then probably gain the secrets and plans from the Mexican Government in some deal. This will deal a great blow to us and we need a plan on how to deal with this. "
 newssovever.6.d:0 "Nikita Khrushchev has been granted asylum into Mexico and has been allowed to stay in a secret location. Khrushchev actually went to the Americans first for asylum, but they said no due to the bad relations and higher tensions it would bring. The Mexican Government however accepted him because of Mexico being known for a haven to escape from enemies and because America might get some help from their friend to the South. Leon Brezhnev said that the USSR will never allow Khrushchev again, and that he better be careful with his life now. Nikita Khrushchev is now in a secret location so that the USSR doesn't send KGB agents out to end his life.  The Mexicans are calling this a great opportunity to have a friendship with the Americans and the start of a new era. What will happen to Khrushchev and the USSR now? Nikita Khrushchev is now in a secret location so that the USSR doesn't send KGB agents out to end his life. The Mexicans are calling this a great blow to the USSR and the start of a great ally. What will happen to Khrushchev and the USSR now? "
 newssovever.5.d:0 "Nikita Khrushchev has been granted asylum into the US and has been allowed to stay in a secret location. The Americans said that they would love to have a man that knows the USSR inside and out and how the USSR performs. They said Khrushchev's secrets and intel will help the effort for the USA since they both now have a common enemy. The USSR however is furious that they would accept a traitor into their country and only shows that the USA is unfair to justice. Leon Brezhnev said that the USSR will never allow Khrushchev again, and that he better be careful with his life now. Nikita Khrushchev is now in a secret location so that the USSR doesn't send KGB agents out to end his life. The Americans are calling this a great blow to the USSR and the start of a great ally.

 every1.6.d:0 "Nikita Khrushchev has landed in Washington D.C. and is now requesting political asylum due to him being removed from Premier in a coup by Leonid Brezhnev and his Committee. If what he said is true and we keep him, then the new USSR will hurt our relations and made tensions high. If we deny him asylum, then he will have to go somewhere else. Mexico would be a suitable place for him there if we don't want him. He however would make a great part in our government and his defection would help us understand Soviet communications, troop placements, and how the USSR works inside and out. He would be a great asset to have. "
 every1.7.d:0 "Nikita Khrushchev escaped from a coup in Moscow from Brezhnev and defected to the USA for political asylum. The Americans however didn't want him because if they took him there would be higher tensions between the USA and the USSR, and also because American-Soviet relations would be severely impacted. The Americans sent him to us to ask us if they would take Khrushchev. Mexico has always been know a haven for people who are escaping other countries. Only over 30 years ago we had Leon Trotsky in Mexico City trying to avoid Stalin and the USSR. Khrushchev would also help us as a political figure and who knows the Americans might like us if we allow him to send Soviet secrets to them? What should we do?"
