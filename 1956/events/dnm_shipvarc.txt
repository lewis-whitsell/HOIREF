#There's a limit to how many events can fit in a namespace.  To play it safe, I'm working with around 100.
#These events are the 'start of the game' events to trigger the ship variant events for technologies a country
#already has at game start.  The idea is to get around reloading resetting the MTTH count, particularly for very
#long MTTHs.
#
# Remember to subtract 2 from each days number.
