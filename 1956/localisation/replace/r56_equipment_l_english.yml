 coastal_defense_ship_desc:0"The Sverige class consisted of three coastal battleships built for the Swedish Navy before World War I. The ships more closely resembled heavy cruisers in both size (displacement of over 6,800 tons) and armament (four 283mm/44 K/45 M12 guns). The ships were relatively slow for a cruiser but were very well-armored. All three ships served during World War II."

The word Nahuel means "Jaguar" in the aboriginal language Mapudungun. It was armed with a 75 mm gun (taken from the Krupp Model 1909 Field Gun used by the Argentine Army) in a rotating armored turret. The design was innovative at the time because it was the only tank, other than the russian T-34, to have a turret built by melting from a single mold thus giving it extra toughness. It's frontal and side armor were slopped, much like the T-34's."

It most likely would have included a better suspension and an a more powerful engine so to comepensate for the added weight. Given the availability of surplus armor at a discount after the war, the Army opted to procure the Sherman Firefly from the UK's inventory instead."
