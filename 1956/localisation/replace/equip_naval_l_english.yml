 battleship_pdn:0 "Pre-Dreadnought"
 battleship_pdn_desc:0 "Pre-Dreadnoughts hearken back to the late 19th and early 20th century, before the lessons of the Battle of Tsushima led to capital ships having one size of main armament, and increasing substantially in speed and size. However, while slow, these vessels still have armament that can be dangerous to anything smaller than a modern battleship."
 battleship_dn:0 "Dreadnought"
 battleship_dn_desc:0 "The first couple of generations of Dreadnoughts still have many things in common with more modern battleships, but tend to have smaller calibre guns, travel at slower speeds and be more lightly armoured."
 battleship_adv_dn:0 "Advanced Dreadnought"
 battleship_adv_dn_desc:0 "The naval arms races of the early 20th century and the First World War lead to rapid development in battleships, and some of the vessels laid down late in World War One were twice the size and considerably more capable than ships built less than ten years earlier."
 destroyer_tb:0 "Torpedo Boat Destroyer"
 destroyer_tb_desc:0 "Destroyers were originally built as counters to torpedo boats, dedicated torpedo delivery vessels.  However, it was soon found that these roles could be merged into a vessel carrying a number of small calibre guns and torpedoes, and thus the torpedo boat destroyer was born.  These vessels were significantly smaller than the destroyers that were developed over the course of the first world war, and those still in service in the 1930s had usually been often been reclassified as torpedo boats."
 destroyer_early_ww1:0 "Early WW1 Destroyer"
 destroyer_early_ww1_desc:0 "The pressures of wartime lead to rapid development in destroyers, which saw increases in size and armament (both gun and torpedo).  Speed also increased."
 destroyer_late_ww1:0 "Late WW1 Destroyer"
 destroyer_late_ww1_desc:0 "By the second half of World War One, destroyers had nearly reached or, in some cases, exceeded, 1000 tons displacement, and had 4inch or 4.7inch guns.  Most the vessels built during this stage of destroyer development were still in service at the outbreak of World War Two."
 light_cruiser_protected:0 "Protected Cruiser"
 light_cruiser_protected_desc:0 "A natural evolution of the frigate concept from the age of sail, the protected cruiser had a long range, reasonable armament and some degree of armour.  However, they were not powerful enough to stand up to the kind of vessels likely to be seen at the centre of a fleet action."
 light_cruiser_scout:0 "Scout Cruiser"
 light_cruiser_scout_desc:0 "The next evolution of the cruiser/scout/raider, scout cruisers were designed to either operate alone, protecting or attacking merchant shipping, or as the eyes of the fleet, scouting out enemy formations and reporting back to the battle line."
 light_cruiser_ww1:0 "WW1 Light Cruiser"
 light_cruiser_ww1_desc:0 "The First World War saw a rapid evolution in cruiser design, which saw a shift to a standard main armament, faster speeds and larger displacements.  Many of the later First World War light cruisers continued to give useful service in the Second World War."
 armoured_cruiser_1:0 "Armoured Cruiser 1"
 armoured_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Faster than the battleships of the day, but still relatively armoured and with more powerful guns than anything except a battleship, armoured cruisers could form the backbone of a local squadron, or part of the battle line, as needs required.  However, they were slow by the standards of modern cruisers, often reaching speeds of only 20 knots."
 armoured_cruiser_2:0 "Armoured Cruiser 2"
 armoured_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The last generation of armoured cruisers, these ships remained slower than the heavy cruisers that would follow them, but also remained more heavily armoured."
 heavy_cruiser_ww1:0 "WW1 Heavy Cruiser"
 heavy_cruiser_ww1_desc:0 "The first proper heavy cruisers were a natural progression from the light cruiser, and were a product of the naval design race between Britain and Germany in the First World War."
 battle_cruiser_early_ww1:0 "Early WW1 Battlecruiser"
 battle_cruiser_early_ww1_desc:0 "Battlecruisers were the faster and lightly armoured counterparts to the dreadnoughts, as the armoured cruisers had been to the pre-dreadnought battleships."
 battle_cruiser_late_ww1:0 "Late WW1 Battlecruiser"
 battle_cruiser_late_ww1_desc:0 "As was the case with the dreadnoughts, there were rapid advances in battlecruiser design from the ships in service at the start of the First World War to those that were commissioned towards the end.  These battlecruisers were larger and more capable, and started to blur the line between battleships and battlecruisers."
 carrier_ww1:0 "WW1 Carrier"
 carrier_ww1_desc:0 "The First World War saw the world's first aircraft carriers.  These vessels, while significantly smaller and slower than more modern carriers, still saw service in the 1930s and 1940s."
 submarine_ww1:0 "WW1 Submarine"
 submarine_ww1_desc:0 "Submarines had been part of the world's navies since around the turn of the century, but it was only in the First World War they became a serious threat.  While submarines of this period were very much dated by the start of World War Two, many navies still had a number of vessels of this vintage in service."

 destroyer_3:0 "Destroyer III"
 destroyer_4:0 "Destroyer IV"
 destroyer_1_desc:0 "To ensure the safety of convoys, the destroyers of the Great War must be repurposed and developed. Arming vessels with more torpedoes will allow more opportunities to engage."
 destroyer_2_desc:0 "Longer torpedo range and faster reload speeds, along with new types of armaments such as anti-air turrets, will allow our destroyers to remain efficient and versatile."
 destroyer_3_desc:0 "To better face threats from above and below, new destroyers must be outfitted with radar and modern anti-air and anti-submarine weaponry."

 light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Maneuverable light cruisers that can maintain a high speed will continue to be useful for scouting missions."
 light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Post-war treaties put restrictions on cruisers, but well-armed light vessels can be developed while remaining within these limits."
 light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Now skirting the limits of treaties, larger and more heavily armored cruisers can be built, still with light enough weaponry to be classified as light cruisers."
 light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Tactically employed to protect larger ships, the modern generation of light cruisers can shake off most past restrictions and be better armed to handle aerial attacks.  This model of light cruiser is set apart by automatic main armament, in fast-training remote-power controlled turrets"

 heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Washington Naval Treaty was set up to prevent an arms race in cruisers, among other ships, but this seems inevitable. By keeping armor light, the weapons load can be increased."
 heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Despite new efforts at treaties, refitting lighter cruisers with heavier weaponry remains efficient, although armor is still limited."
 heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "As restrictions are increasingly ignored worldwide, more balanced heavy cruiser designs with more priority on armor can be built. Better anti-air guns allow these ships to cooperate in naval air warfare."

 ENG_submarine_ww1:0 "Improved H Class "
 ENG_submarine_ww1_desc:0 "The Improved H Class submarines were medium-sized WW1 vessels, a few of which were still in service at the start of World War Two and saw limited action, despite being largely obsolete." 
 ENG_submarine_1:0 "Oberon Class "
 ENG_submarine_1_desc:0 "The Oberon was the first British patrol submarine developed in the 1920s, with intermediate range and six bow and two stern 21 inch torpedo tubes, as well as a four-inch gun. They heralded the beginning of the O, P and R class submarines that characteristed British submarine development at the time."
 #ENG_submarine_1b: "O/P/R Class"
 #ENG_submarine_1c: "S Class"
 ENG_submarine_2:0 "Triton Class "
 ENG_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Triton or T Class boats were designed by Britain to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 ENG_submarine_3:0 "U Class "
 ENG_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited."
 #ENG_submarine_3b: "Seraph Class"
 ENG_submarine_4:0 "A Class "
 ENG_submarine_4_desc:0 "A, or Amphion class submarines were large, long-range vessels designed for operations in the Pacific, with a load of 20 torpedoes and much improved diving time, radar arrangements and sound insulation compared with previous British submarines."
 #ENG_submarine_4b: "Amphion Class"
 ENG_destroyer_tb:0 "Avon Class"
 ENG_destroyer_tb_desc:0 "Torpedo boat destroyers built as part of the 1985-96 programme, these ships displaced just 355 tons, had a complement of 63, and were armed with on three inch gun, five smaller six-pounders and two 18 inch torpedoes.  They could make 30 knots and, while well surpassed by more modern vessels during the First World War, still gave useful service in coastal patrol work."
 ENG_destroyer_early_ww1:0 "Beagle Class"
 ENG_destroyer_early_ww1_desc:0 "Displacing nearly three times as much as destroyers only ten years prior, these vessels were actually slower than the Avon class, only making 27 knots.  They were more heavily armed, however, with a four inch gun, three 3 inch guns and two 21 inch torpedo tubes (and four torpedoes).  Due to the large numbers of more advanced destroyers built during the First World War, these ships were retired not long after the end of hostilities."
 ENG_destroyer_late_ww1:0 "V Class "
 ENG_destroyer_late_ww1_desc:0 "These were amongst the oldest British destroyers still in active service in 1936. They first saw service in August 1917, and were armed with four 4 inch guns, one 3 inch anti-aircraft gun, and two double 21 inch torpedo tubes.  They had a top speed of 34 knots, although during World War Two many had one boiler removed and were converted to slower but longer-ranged escort destroyers."
 ENG_destroyer_1:0 "Amazon Class "
 ENG_destroyer_1_desc:0 "HMS Amazon was one of two (the other was HMS Ambuscade) mid-1920s prototype destroyers, which formed the basis for Britain's new post-war destroyer designs.  These ships were armed with 4.7 inch guns, 2 two-pounder pom-poms for anti-aircraft defence and six 21 inch torpedo tubes in two triple mounts.  Amazon and Ambuscade could make 37 knots, although later destroyers were generally a little slower."
 #ENG_destroyer_1b: "A/B/C/D Class"
 ENG_destroyer_2:0 "E/F Class "
 ENG_destroyer_2_desc:0 "A more advanced British interwar destroyer, these ships had more efficient machinery but similar armament to preceding classes.  These ships were used heavily on convoy escort duties, and had a strong anti-submarine weapon loadout, carrying 70 depth charges and, when it had been developed, the hedgehog anti-submarine mortar."
 #ENG_destroyer_2b: "Tribal Class"
 ENG_destroyer_3:0 "L/M Class "
 ENG_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The L/M class destroyers were enlarged versions of the preceding J/K/N class, but with a more advanced and powerful 4.7 inch gun (the 4.7 inch QF Mk XI) which, with 50 degrees of elevation, allowed for a measure of use against aircraft as well as surface vessels.  As with most Second World War British destroyer designs, these vessels had large depth charge armaments."
 ENG_destroyer_4:0 "Battle Class "
 ENG_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 #ENG_destroyer_4b: "Weapon Class"
 ENG_light_cruiser_protected:0 "Eclipse Class"
 ENG_light_cruiser_protected_desc:0 "Built in the mid-1890s, the Eclipse second class cruisers (as they were known in the Royal Navy) could make 19.5 knots, had an armour that was three inches at its thickest, and was armed with five 6 inch guns and six 4.7 inch guns, as well as a variety of smaller weaponry and three 18 in torpedo tubes. Despite their age, most took part in the First World War (with at least one forming part of the naval squadron at the Gallipoli landings.  They were retired shortly after that war concluded."
 ENG_light_cruiser_scout:0 "Bristol Class"
 ENG_light_cruiser_scout_desc:0 "These ships were the first true cruisers built for the Royal Navy since the turn of the century.  They displaced 4800 tons, could make 25 knots, and were armed with two 6 inch and ten 4 inch guns, as well as two 18 inch torpedo tubes.  They gave good service during the First World War, but were retired shortly afterwards as the Royal Navy had since built numerous, better cruisers."
 ENG_light_cruiser_ww1:0 "Caledon Class "
 ENG_light_cruiser_ww1_desc:0 "The Caledon Class were the youngest of the excellent C-class light cruisers of the Royal Navy to serve in the Second World War. They were built during the First World War and proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys."
 ENG_light_cruiser_1:0 "Emerald Class "
 ENG_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "The first new cruisers built by Britain since the First World War, these ships displaced 7300t, making them some of the largest light cruisers yet built.  Further, at 33 knots, they were also amongst the fastest (and were Britain's fastest light cruisers at the start of the Second World War).  They had seven 6-inch guns and a relatively heavy (for the time) torpedo armament of twelve 21-inch tubes."
 #ENG_light_cruiser_1b: "Emerald Class"
 #ENG_light_cruiser_1c: "Amphion Class"
 ENG_light_cruiser_2:0 "Leander Class "
 ENG_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Leander class cruisers were built by Britain in the early 1930s as small but powerful ships designed for trade protection, designed to be well within treaty limits to allowe more ships in the class to be built. Even so, they mounted eight 6 inch guns in four twin turrets, four 4 inch dual-purpose guns and eight 21 inch torpedo tubes in two quadruple mounts, and would go on to give good service throughout the Second World War."
 #ENG_light_cruiser_2b: "Edinburgh Class"
 ENG_light_cruiser_3:0 "Edinburgh Class "
 ENG_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Edinburgh class were improved versions of the earlier Southhampton class. The ships carried the same main armament as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in guns, but they had improved ammunition handling, stronger anti-aircraft armament and an improved armour scheme."
 #ENG_light_cruiser_3b: "Dido Class"
 ENG_light_cruiser_4:0 "Neptune Class "
 ENG_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "While never built, the Neptune class was a wartime British design for a light cruiser that had automatic, remote-powered 6-inch guns, advanced anti-aircraft defenses and relatively robust armour. Had these been built, they would have comfortably outclassed early models of light cruiser."
 ENG_armoured_cruiser_1:0 "Diadem Class"
 ENG_armoured_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Displacing 11,000 tons and with a top speed of just over 20 knots, the Diadem class were designed with economy and trade protection in mind.  Unlike many armoured cruisers of the time, their largest gun was just six inches, but it carried 16 of them, as well as 14 three inch guns and three 18 inch torpedoes.  They saw service in the First World War, but were all retired by or shortly after it's end."
 ENG_armoured_cruiser_2:0 "Warrior Class"
 ENG_armoured_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Warrior class were large ships, displacing over 13,000 tons, with this displacement used to support a main armament of six 9.2 inch guns and a secondary armament of four 7.5 inch guns, protected by a belt that was up to six inches thick and over seven inches of armour on the turret faces.  These vessels were able to make 23 knots, were good seaboats and stable gun platforms and had a good reputation, but the surviving ships were all retired after World War One."
 ENG_heavy_cruiser_ww1:0 "Hawkins Class "
 ENG_heavy_cruiser_ww1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 ENG_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Kent Class "
 ENG_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Kent class were Britain's first 'treaty cruisers', built to the limits of the 1922 Washington naval arms limitatino treaty. While these vessels were, on paper, more lightly armoured than most of the heavy cruisers in other navies, they proved resilient ships and were armed with a capable eight 8-inch guns in four twin turrets. However, at 31.5 knots were a bit slower than a number of other 1920s heavy cruisers."
 #ENG_heavy_cruiser_1b: "County Class"
 ENG_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class "
 ENG_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they had been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 ENG_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class "
 ENG_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 ENG_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 ENG_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser."
 ENG_battle_cruiser_early_ww1:0 "Invincible Class"
 ENG_battle_cruiser_early_ww1_desc:0 "The first British battlecruisers, these ships were heavily armed, with eight 12 inch guns capable of firing, using cross-deck fire, as a single broadside. Further, at 25 knots they were also very quick for their time.  However, with just six inches of belt armour and 7 inches of armour on their turret faces, these ships were poorly equipped to face full-fledged battleships."
 ENG_battle_cruiser_late_ww1:0 "Renown Class "
 ENG_battle_cruiser_late_ww1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 ENG_battle_cruiser_1:0 "G3 Class "
 ENG_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The British G3-class battlecruisers were an advanced design that were never built due to the Washington Naval Treaties, but had they been constructed, would have been amongst the fastest and most heavily armoured ships of their time, with nine 16 inch guns as a main armament, a top speed of over 31 knots, 12 inches of belt armour and up to 8 inches of deck armour."
 #ENG_battle_cruiser_1b: "Admiral Class"
 ENG_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 ENG_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal is a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 ENG_battleship_pdn:0 "Majestic Class"
 ENG_battleship_pdn_desc:0 "The largest battleships yet built when constructed, these ships had four 12 inch guns as their main armament, twelve 6 inch guns and various smaller calibres, as well as five 18 inch torpedo tubes. They were protected by a 9 inch belt and a 4 inch deck, and could make up to 17 knots.  They were active into the first half of World War One (two taking part in the Dardanelles campaign), before being converted into depot ships and similar."
 ENG_battleship_dn:0 "Dreadnought Class"
 ENG_battleship_dn_desc:0 "HMS Dreadnought was the first of the all-big gun battleships to be put into commission, and was armed with ten 12 inch guns as a main armament.  Her turbine engines could push her to 21 knots, and she was protected by an 11 inch belt and turret faces and a deck up to three inches thick. She gave good service during the First World War (including becoming the only battleship to have sunk a submarine, U-29, by ramming), but was retired in 1920, having been left behind by the rapid pace of battleship development."
 ENG_battleship_adv_dn:0 "Queen Elizabeth Class "
 ENG_battleship_adv_dn_desc:0 "The Queen Elizabeth-class battleships were ordered under the 1912 Naval Program. These ships were the first to be equipped with 15 in. guns, and were considered the first fast battleships. They carried heavy armament for both primary and secondary roles and their thick armor made these vessels excellent warships, ideal for protecting the vast British Empire. Six ships were ordered but only five were commissioned and later modernized prior to WWII."
 ENG_battleship_1:0 "Nelson Class "
 ENG_battleship_1_desc:0 "The first treaty battleships, the Nelson Class were limited in their displacement, which meant they were a compromise between armour, firepower and speed.  Choosing protection over speed, they made 23 knots but due to their innovative design, were still heavily armed, with nine 16-inch guns, and very well armoured, with 14 inch belt armour and deck armour that was 6 inches thick at its thickest point.  This was made possible by placing all of the main armament forward of the bridge, shortening the armoured citadel and saving weight."
 #ENG_battleship_1b: "Nelson Class"
 ENG_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class "
 ENG_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 ENG_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class "
 ENG_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 ENG_battleship_4:0 "Superb Class"
 ENG_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 ENG_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion is a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 ENG_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 ENG_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 ENG_carrier_ww1:0 "Eagle Class "
 ENG_carrier_ww1_desc:0 "The Eagle Class was the Royal Navy's first flush-decked aircraft carrier, converted from a partially-built battleship in the closing years of World War 1. As a converted vessel, its complement of around 21 aircraft was less than its displacement would otherwise have suggested, but HMS Eagle nonetheless proved a useful addition to the fleet."
 ENG_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class "
 ENG_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 ENG_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class "
 ENG_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She is the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel is well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 ENG_carrier_3:0 "Implacable Class "
 ENG_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
 ENG_carrier_4:0 "Malta Class "
 ENG_carrier_4_desc:0 "Never completed by Britain, as the end of the war meant drastic reductions in the naval budget, these ships were developed based on the experience of the US Pacific operations (while still taking into account the more varied needs of Royal Navy vessels).  The Malta class was designed to have a large hangar, supporting over 80 aircraft (and holding many more with a deck park), strong anti-air armament and well-designed armour and damage control."

 FRA_submarine_1:0 "Sirène Class "
 FRA_submarine_1_desc:0 "The Sirène class were the first of the 600-ton series of submarines. They were large coastal submarines, displacing around 600tons, and used mostly used in the shallow, warm waters of the Mediterranean. They had seven 550mm torpdoed tubes (and carried 13 torpedoes on a patrol), as well as a 75mm gun and two 8mm machine guns."

 FRA_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Minerve-class submarines (project name T2) were based on the 630-ton Series though they had better engines and different torpedo layout. These submarines were the first part of the standardization program resulting of a centralized design of the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale) rather than shipyard specific designs of the previous classes."
 #FRA_submarine_2b: "Aurore Class"
 FRA_submarine_3:0 "Roland Morillot Class "
 FRA_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Roland Morillot class were a planned class of fleet submarines, to be armed with ten 21.7 inch torpedo tubes, two 15.7 inch torpedo tubes, a 3.9 inch gun and two 13.2mm machine guns. Capable of 22 knots surfaced (but only 9 knots submerged), they were to be long-ranged. France fell, however, before any could be completed."
 FRA_submarine_4:0 "Phénix Class "
 FRA_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Phénix-class submarines were medium sized ocean-going and long range boats authorized in the 1939-40 naval programs but the start of the war and the Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these boats. They were similar to the Redoutable class though they were smaller and displaced 1,200 tons. They carried a similarly heavy torpedo armament."
 FRA_destroyer_tb:0 "Claymore Class"
 FRA_destroyer_tb_desc:0 "Built in the first decade of the 20th century, these destroyers were already outclassed by those in the British Navy at the time of their construction. They were armed with two 450mm torpedo tubes, one 67mm and six 47mm guns, and capable of 28 knots, but at just 350 tons this amount of armament contributed to them being top heavy. Most were stricken in the early 1920s."
 FRA_destroyer_early_ww1:0 "Bouclier Class"
 FRA_destroyer_early_ww1_desc:0 "Displacing 800 tons and capable of 30 knots, the Bouclier class were significantly larger and a little faster than earlier types. They were armed with two 100mm and four 65mm guns, and two twin 450mm torpedo tubes. Outdated by the end of the First World War, all had been retired from service by the early 1930s."
 FRA_destroyer_1:0 "Bourrasque Class "
 FRA_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Bourrasque-class destroyers were part of the 1,500-ton Series, and launched in the mid 1920's. Together with the preceding Chacal and following L'Adroit classes, they were the backbone of the new modern post war French fleet.

 FRA_destroyer_4:0 "Hoche Class"
 #FRA_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Hoche and Bayard classes were the final super destroyer design of the French Navy. Both classes were based on the Mogador class, displacing 4,200 tons with a similar main armament but improved AA guns and stronger engines.

 FRA_light_cruiser_protected:0 "Guichen Class"
 FRA_light_cruiser_protected_desc:0 "Built with commerce raiding in mind, the Guichen class displaced 8,151 tons and could make a speed of 23.5 knots, but was relatively lightly armed for a ship of that size, with two 6.4 inch guns, six 5.5 inch guns and ten three-pounders. The only ship in this class was stricken in 1922."
 FRA_light_cruiser_1:0 "Duguay-Trouin Class "
 FRA_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Duguay-Trouin light cruisers were the first major French warships built after World War I in the 1922 naval program. They became the first light cruisers with super-firing enclosed main turrets. Among light cruisers, they had a strong torpedo armament but virtually nonexistent armor."
 FRA_light_cruiser_2:0 "La Galissonnière Class "
 FRA_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The La Galissonnière-class light cruisers were the answer to the Italian Condottieri type light cruisers and were based on the previous Emile Bertin class. They were built in the 1931 and 1932 naval programs, with typical main armament and adequate AA armament of the era. They displaced 10,850 tons, had an increased amount of scout planes, and had good speed."
 FRA_light_cruiser_3:0 "De Grasse Class "
 FRA_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The DeGrasse-class cruisers were authorized in the 1938 and 1939 naval programs and were essentially improved La Galissonnières. They had stronger AA armament as well as bigger engines. The Fall of France caused the last two ships to be cancelled and the lead ship to be finished post-war as a different design. The Germans intended to finish her as a light carrier but this project was also not carried out."
 FRA_light_cruiser_4:0 "Colbert Class"
 FRA_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Colbert was an anti-aircraft light cruiser launched in 1956. This Colbert-class cruiser was built in a very similar way to the post-war De Grasse, featuring heavy AA armament both for long and short ranges. The difference between Colbert and DeGrasse is that the Colbert had smaller engines, thinner armor, and was slightly smaller."
 FRA_armoured_cruiser_1:0 "Jeanne D'Arc Class"
 FRA_armoured_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Jeanne D'Arc was France's first large ocean-going armoured cruiser. While not a bad design, she was lightly armed for her size, with a main armament of just two 7.6 inch guns, fourteen 5.5 inch guns and sixteen two-pounders. Her top speed was 21.8 knots."
 FRA_armoured_cruiser_2:0 "Léon Gambetta Class"
 FRA_armoured_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Léon Gambetta class was the first class of the last generation of French armoured cruisers. Considered good ships when launched, they were quickly surpassed in the naval arms race of the early 20th century, and their top speed of 22.5 knots, and armament of four 7.6 inch guns, sixteen 6.4 inch guns and twenty-four three-pounders did not stand the test of time."
 FRA_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Duquesne Class "
 FRA_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Duquesne class were France's first 'treaty cruisers'. Built to the 10,000 ton limit, they were armed with four twin 203mm turrets and were capable of nearly 34 knots, but this came at the expense of rather light armour. Like most French interwar ships, anti-aircraft armament was limited in capability."
 FRA_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Algérie Class "
 FRA_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Algérie-class heavy cruiser were a further improvement of the previous classes of the Suffren and Duquesne but designed to be the opponent of the new Italian heavy cruisers of the Zara class. Both the main armor belt and underwater protection is considerably increased. Its AA armament is adequate for its time, but due to these changes, the standard displacement is over 10,000 tons."
 FRA_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Saint Louis Class "
 FRA_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Saint Louis-class heavy cruisers were based on the Algérie class but the overall look was closer to that of the Dunkerque and Richelieu class capital ships. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval program, but due to the Fall of France none of them were laid down. They would field new guns and improved AA armament but the armor would be the same as on the Algérie class. It was the last heavy cruiser design of the French Navy."
 FRA_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Forbin Class"
 FRA_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Forbin-class heavy cruisers were a hypothetical design as a follow up of the Saint Louis class. Designed to defend the trade lanes between Mainland France and the colonies, it had long range and good speed along with a heavy armament of guns in four triple turrets and an adequate number of AA weaponry. The ship layout and general look resembled an influence from the previous Saint Louis class as well as British Crown Colony class."
 FRA_battle_cruiser_late_ww1:0 "Durand-Viel Design"
 FRA_battle_cruiser_late_ww1_desc:0 "The Durand-Viel design of battlecruiser was a proposal among a series of studies dating back to WWI. They were essentially the battlecruiser versions of the Normandie and Lyon classes of battleship featuring the same quad turrets and guns though in reduced number. Like contemporary British battlecruisers, they would be faster but less armored than a battleship. They were cancelled before WWI broke out."
 FRA_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Dunkerque Class "
 FRA_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Dunkerques were designed to counter the German Deutschland-class pocket battleships. They were the apex of a series design studies from the mid 1920's to early 1930's. Authorized in the 1931 and 1934 naval programs, they were similar to the British Nelson-class battleships, with all of their main turrets concentrated forward. This resulted in a shorter belt armor and thus a smaller ship to fit into the Naval Treaties limitations."
 FRA_battleship_pdn:0 "Charlemagne Class"
 FRA_battleship_pdn_desc:0 "These were France's first battleships with twin turrets (holding 305mm guns), backed up by ten single 139mm guns, eight 100mm guns and twenty 47mm guns. They had a top speed of 18 knots and generally reasonable turret and belt armour, but were vulnerable to damage above the waterline. The last ship in this class was stricken in 1920."
 FRA_battleship_dn:0 "Courbet Class "
 FRA_battleship_dn_desc:0 "The Courbet-class battleships were the first dreadnoughts built for the French Navy before and during the First World War. Authorized in the 1910 and 1911 naval programs, they only saw limited service during both world wars. Though they had thicker armor and stronger guns than the previous Danton class battleships, they were still inferior to contemporary USN and RN battleships. They displaced just over 22,000 tons and while they underwent limited modernisation, were outdated by the mid-1930s."
 FRA_battleship_adv_dn:0 "Bretagne Class "
 FRA_battleship_adv_dn_desc:0 "France's first super-dreadnought design was the Bretagne class, three ships with five twin 340mm turrets all on the centreline, reasonable armour for the time and capable of 20 knots speed. These ships were modernised between the wars, with increased speed and gun range, as well as anti-aircraft armament, and were still useful (if slow) combat units at the start of World War Two."
 FRA_battleship_1:0 "Lyon Class"
 FRA_battleship_1_desc:0 "Never built due to first the impact of World War One on French shipbuilding, and then post-war naval treaties, these ships were to have displaced 29,000 tons and be armed with sixteen 13.4mm guns, giving them a strong broadside, although at the expense of less displacement being available for armour. Speed was designed to reach 23 knots."
 #FRA_battleship_1b: "Bretagne Class" 
 FRA_battleship_2:0 "Richelieu Class "
 FRA_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Richelieu-class battleships were the last battleships commissioned into the French Navy. They were an improved design of the Dunkerque and authorized under the 1935 and 1938 naval programs. They had excellent AA armament, speed and range, which made it an excellent capital ship. Out of the four ordered, only two were launched and one was completed before the Fall of France. There were numerous attempts to finish the remaining ships using different designs, proposed for use as anti-aircraft battleships, battleship-carrier hybrids, or full scale carriers."
 FRA_battleship_3:0 "Alsace Class"
 FRA_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Alsace-class battleships were planned to succeed the Richelieu class. Four ships were ordered, with the design studies finished in 1939, authorized in 1940, and expected to be laid down in 1941, though the Fall of France prevented this from happening. It improves upon the Richelieu design with heavier and more numerous main guns, stronger AA armament, thicker armor plates, and larger engines."
 FRA_carrier_1:0 "Béarn Class "
 FRA_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Béarn was originally laid down as a Normandie-class battleship but later finished as an aircraft carrier, displacing 22,100 tons and serving during the interbellum years and WWII. As a converted carrier, its speed was slow and it had limited space for aircraft, but the medium armor belt and long range made up for these shortcomings. Its construction gave important experience to the French designers in the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale) and led to a series of design studies afterward."
 FRA_carrier_2:0 "Joffre Class "
 FRA_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Joffre-class carriers (Project name PA-16) were the next generation of carriers for the French Navy. It was the last of the design studies that started in 1929 and ended in 1937. Two ships were authorized in the 1938 naval program, but the escalating conflicts slowed down the construction process and eventually the Fall of France prevented the completion of these ships. Displacement would be around 20,000 tons. They would have good AA armament, armor, and speed, but a below-average aircraft complement. Overall, it would have been a well-rounded and versatile carrier for the French Navy."
 FRA_carrier_3:0 "Jean Bart Class"
 FRA_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Jean Bart carrier was a mid-war proposal to convert the unfinished Richelieu class battleship Jean Bart into a full scale carrier in a similar way to the Japanese IJN Shinano. The hull's large size would be resulted in a large aircraft component and together with the big engines a long range and fast carrier. The heavy AA armament of US origin would provide a good defense against aircraft and smaller surface combatants."
 FRA_carrier_4:0 "Clemenceau Class"
 FRA_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Clemenceau class aircraft carrier (Project name PA-28) were the first postwar carrier design of the French Navy. The design would be similar to the unfinished Joffre class carriers, though the installed equipment and weaponry would be of modern French products. The acquisition of the USN and RN escort carriers and the economical state of postwar France prevented these ships from being laid down. Not to be confused with the latter Clemenceau class aircraft carriers (Project name PA-54), which were laid down in 1955 and 1957."

 JAP_battleship_3_desc:0 "The hypothetical successors to the Yamato class were to have an even stronger main armament of 510mm cannons and a strong AA armament of the newest type. Their armor thickness was designed to withstand even shells from its own cannons, and they would have displaced around 80,000tons."
 #JAP_battleship_4:0 "Iwami Class"
 #JAP_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Iwami class was a hypothetical class of battleships, that utilized new methods to speed up construction. They were well-armed with new cannons and heavy AA guns, and could match any similarly armed vessels for firepower. However, the resulting improvements meant a heavier and thus somewhat slower class of ships."
 #JAP_SH_battleship_1:0 "Yamato Class"
 #JAP_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Yamato class consisted of the heaviest battleships ever created, displacing 72,000 tons, and the ships were designed to be the pride and might of the Japanese navy under the Peace Goddesses plan. Each ship carried nine 460-millimetre naval guns, the largest naval artillery ever fitted to a warship."
 #JAP_SH_battleship_2:0 "Super Yamato Class"
 #JAP_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The hypothetical Super Yamato class saw the Yamato was used as a base, but the weapons would be even stronger with a main armament of 51cm cannons and a strong AA armament of the newest type. Their armor thickness was designed to withstand even shells from its own cannons, and they would displace around 70-80.000tons."
 #JAP_carrier_ww1:0 "Hosho Class "
 #JAP_carrier_ww1_desc:0 "The first ship to be completed as a purpose-built, flush-decked aircraft carrier, the Hosho class was, by the 1930s, small, slow and outdated. Accordingly, she was used primarily for training, but when the need required (such as for the Battle of Midway), she was still capable of combat operations."
 JAP_carrier_1:0 "Kaga Class "
 JAP_carrier_1_desc:0 "The aircraft carrier Kaga was Japan's first fleet carrier. She was originally a battleship, but finished as an aircraft carrier. This resulted in a large and heavily armored carrier with limited space for improvement. However, it was an important experience in aircraft carrier construction for the Imperial Japanese Navy."
 #JAP_carrier_1b: "Akagi Class" (refit Kaga class)
 JAP_carrier_2:0 "Soryu Class "
 JAP_carrier_2_desc:0 "Soryu and Hiryu were designed with mirrored island superstructure to speed up aircraft recovery processes while sailing next to each other. They were fast carriers with room for large air groups, but minimally armored. They displaced 20.000tons and large engines provided high speed and a long range of operations."
 #JAP_carrier_2b: "Hiryu Class"
 JAP_carrier_3:0 "Shokaku Class "
 JAP_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Shokaku class aircraft carriers were designed for high speed, long radius of action, heavy protection and a large aircraft capacity, which made them excellent carriers. Due to the improved construction methods, they displaced 33.000tons full load, and could survive more damage than most contemporary carriers."
 #JAP_carrier_3b: "Hiyo Class"
 JAP_carrier_4:0 "Kai-Taiho Class"
 #JAP_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Taiho class aircraft carrier was the IJN's first fully armored carriers, with an armored flight deck to withstand multiple bomb and torpedo hits and still function effectively. A large air group together AND heavy AA armament would provide not just self-defense but also force projection over enemy forces."

 SOV_submarine_ww1_desc:0 "Amerikansky Golland (American Holland) class submarines were built in Canada, then delivered to Russia during WWI, where they were finally assembled. They were the direct copy of the successful Holland type submarines. They were designed to be good sea boats well-armed for their time."
 SOV_submarine_1:0 "Dekabrist Class "
 SOV_submarine_1_desc:0 "The first Soviet-built submarines, they were based on ideas in the designs of modern Italian and First World War German boats. Soviet shipwrights inexperience with submarines meant they had a number of teething issues, but they proved a vital first step for the future Soviet submarine programme."
 #SOV_submarine_1b: "Series I Debakrist"
 SOV_submarine_2:0 "Series X class "
 SOV_submarine_2_desc:0 "Improved versions of the earlier Series V, or Shchuka, class. They were medium-sized patrol submarines with good torpedo armament and seaworthiness, and many were built. The had six 533mm torpedo tubes (four on the bow and two in the stern) and displaced 584 tons surfaced."

 SOV_submarine_4:0 "Project 611"
 SOV_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Project 611 submarines (NATO Codename: Zulu), were the Soviet Navy's first submarine class to be built after WWII. Their design was based on the German Type XXI submarines, and they were meant to replace the older Series XIV K class boats. They were large, ocean-going submarines with a heavy torpedo armament and long range. They were used as a basis for the follow-up Project 613 (NATO Codename: Whiskey) and Project 641 (NATO Codename: Foxtrot) class submarines."
 SOV_destroyer_tb:0 "General Kondratenko Class "
 SOV_destroyer_tb_desc:0 "Technically a 'torpedo cruiser', the four ships of the General Kondratenko class were built in Germany and commissioned in 1906. They had a top speed of just over 25 knots, and a main armament of two 75mm guns and three 450mm torpedo tubes. One ship, Konstruktor, was still in service into the Second World War."

 SOV_destroyer_early_ww1_desc:0 "The Leytenant Shestakov class were armed with one 120mm gun, five 75mm guns and three 450mm torpedo tubes. All four vessels in the class were well out of service by the 1930s."
 SOV_destroyer_late_ww1:0 "Novik Class "
 SOV_destroyer_late_ww1_desc:0 "Novik was the lead ship of four very similar classes that, when first commissioned in 1913, were the fastest and most heavily-armed destroyers in any navy. While they were quickly surpassed with the rapid evolution of destroyers in World War One, their strengths meant some remained in service into the 1950s."
 SOV_destroyer_1:0 "Leningrad Class "
 SOV_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The first destroyer class built and designed by the Soviet Union, the Leningrad Class were flotilla leaders, displacing 2,282 tons and armed with five 130mm guns and eight 533mm torpedo tubes.  With a maximum speed of 43 knots they were very fast, but they lacked seakeeping and had other design issues."
 #SOV_destroyer_1b: "Leningrad & Minsk Class"
 SOV_destroyer_2:0 "Gnevny Class "
 SOV_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Gnevny class (Project 7) destroyers were authorized under the 1933-1938 shipbuilding program. The class itself was heavily influenced by the Italian destroyer Maestrale and considered a successful design. Their displacement were in the range of 1,600-2,000 tons, they were well-armed and they had adequate AA and torpedo armament. Due to the powerful engines they were fast but short-ranged vessels."
 SOV_destroyer_3:0 "Ognevoi Class "
 SOV_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Ognevoi (Project 30) destroyers were an improved version of the previous Project 7U ships. They mounted their main armament in twin turrets, increasing stability, and had a stronger anti-aircraft armament. While originally laid down in 1939, the impact of World War Two meant the first wasn't commissioned until 1945."
 #SOV_destroyer_3b: "Ognevoy Class"
 SOV_destroyer_4:0 "Skoryi Class"
 SOV_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Skoryi class (Project 30bis), first laid down in 1948, was a further improvement on the Ognevoi class. The increase in size and displacement (2,500-3,100 tons) resulted in a more stable ship with an increased operational range. All ships were built after the War to a modular design that resulted in rapid construction and deployment times. Higher freeboard gave them somewhat better seakeeping than earlier Soviet destroyers."
 SOV_light_cruiser_protected:0 "Bogatyr Class "
 SOV_light_cruiser_protected_desc:0 "The last protected cruisers built in Russia, the Bogatyr class were fast and well-armed for their time, but by the 1930s, that time was decades in the past. Of the four completed vessels only one remained, Komintern, used mainly as a minelayer until scuttled as a breakwater in 1942. At the time of World War Two, she was armed with eight 130mm guns, and only capable of 12 knots."
 SOV_light_cruiser_ww1:0 "Krasnyi Krym Class "
 SOV_light_cruiser_ww1_desc:0 "The Krasnyi Krym class cruiser, originally the Svetlana class cruiser, had her construction started before WWI but the war and the following revolution delayed the completion of the entire class. In the mid-late 1920's, she was finally commissioned into the Soviet Navy along with her half-sister Chervona Ukraina (ex Admiral Nakhimov). These vessels were the first turbine-driven cruisers of the Imperial Russian Navy. They were heavily armed and well-armored cruisers for their time."
 SOV_light_cruiser_2:0 "Komsomolets Class"
 SOV_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Komsomolets class light cruisers were series of hypothetical vessels. They were somewhat of a mix of older and new technologies. Using the incomplete hulls of the Svetlana and Admiral Nakhimov classes, the ship's construction costs were reduced. Equipped with six twin turrets of smaller, destroyer caliber guns and adequate AA armament they were suited for scouting and a destroyer flotilla leader role. The overall design of the ships bears similarities to the Kirov class cruisers."
 SOV_light_cruiser_3:0 "Chapayev Class "
 SOV_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Chapayev class (Project 68) cruisers were based on the Kirov class (Project 26) cruisers and authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program. The first light cruisers laid down by the Soviet Union, they carried a strong anti-surface and anti-air armament together with an adequate torpedo armament. Overall, these were good ships with a thick armor belt, high speed, a good operational range, and a displacement of 10,500 to 14,000 tons. Due to the war and the invasion of the German forces, many ships of the class were cancelled and the rest were finished after the hostilities ended."
 SOV_light_cruiser_4:0 "Sverdlov Class"
 SOV_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Sverdlov class cruisers (Project 68bis) were the last gun cruisers of the Soviet Navy and were improved versions of the preceding Chapayev class. Compared to the Chapayevs, they had the same main armament, machinery and armor protection, but had increased fuel capacity for greater range, improved underwater protection, an increased anti-aircraft battery, and slightly better seaworthiness. They were designed for the roles of convoy hunting and capital ship escorts. Due to the advent of the missile age, many ships were cancelled or not finished."
 SOV_armoured_cruiser_1:0 "Bayan Class"
 SOV_armoured_cruiser_1_desc:0 "A class of four ships, two built in France and two built in Russia, these were competent cruisers for the late 19th century but an unsuccesful artillery configuration meant that the three ships that survived the Russo-Japanese War  were out of date before World War One broke out. All had been broken up by the end of the 1920s."
 SOV_armoured_cruiser_2:0 "Ryurik Class"
 SOV_armoured_cruiser_2_desc:0 "A 16,900 ton monster built in Britain for Russia, the armoured cruiser Ryurik was a reaction to the Russo-Japanese war, and was designed to be able to fight in the line of battle when necessary, with four 254mm guns, eight 203mm guns and 152mm of belt armour. Vertical protection was weak, however, and after the Russian Civil War the ship was scrapped."
 SOV_heavy_cruiser_ww1:0 "Krasnyi Kavkaz Class "
 SOV_heavy_cruiser_ww1_desc:0 "The Krasnyi Kavkaz cruiser, originally the Admiral Nakhimov class light cruiser, was the half-sister of the Chervona Ukraina. Krasnyi Kavkaz was completed with a modified design that included larger-caliber 180mm guns and stronger AA armament. Because she was a rebuilt light cruiser, her armor was thinner compared to the heavy cruisers of other navies."
 SOV_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Kirov Class "
 SOV_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Kirov class (Project 26) cruisers were the Soviet Navy's first modern cruisers. The design was based on the Italian Raimondo Montecuccoli class light cruisers and was built as part of the 1933-1938 shipbuilding program. The ships displaced between 7,700 and 9,200 tons. They were armed with new 180mm guns in 3 triple turrets and a solid AA battery. Their strong engines provided good speed and an acceptable operational range, while the armor belt was thin compared to other heavy cruisers."

 SOV_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Project 22"
 SOV_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Project 22 heavy cruisers were designed in the mid 1930's to counter similar vessels in neighboring countries. The design called for a larger-sized vessel displacing between 15,500 and 17,000 tons. They were equipped with four triple 240mm cannons to fight off enemy cruisers, a heavy AA armament for self-defense, and a larger scout plane force to find the enemy. Their main tasks would be to scout for enemy forces and convoy hunting. The cost of the ships and the allocation of resources to other needs resulted in the cancellation of the project."
 SOV_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Project 66"
 SOV_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Project 66 heavy cruisers were the Soviet Navy's last attempt to design and build a purely gun cruiser. Design studies started in 1943 and the final version emerged after the war. The vessels would feature 220mm cannons in 3 triple turrets and a strong AA armament. Displacement would be at least 26,500 tons. The advent of the missile age and the death of Josef Stalin caused the project to be terminated."
 SOV_battle_cruiser_late_ww1:0 "Borodino Class"
 SOV_battle_cruiser_late_ww1_desc:0 "The Borodino-class battlecruisers were class of four vessels authorized in 1914, just before WWI. They were based on the Imperatritsa Mariya class battleships. They followed the contemporary Russian capital ship building practices of using four triple turrets to house the heavy main armament, strong secondary armament in casemates, and an overall flush-deck. They had a low profile with low draught to fight in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea. Like many Russian ships of this period, the outbreak of WWI and the Russian Revolution doomed these ships from ever being finished."

The original design aimed for a large-sized heavy cruiser of 23,000 tons, but after information on German Scharnhorst battlecruisers arrived, the ships were redesigned to displace to 35,000 tons. As hostilities broke out between Germany and the Soviet Union, the ships construction was halted and eventually cancelled. Alternative plans called for finishing the incomplete hulls as aircraft carriers under Project 69AV."
 SOV_battleship_pdn:0 "Peresvet Class"
 SOV_battleship_pdn_desc:0 "Built in Russia, these three ships were relatively slow and poorly armed for the time, with the four 254mm guns backed up by eleven 152mm and twenty 75mm guns. Two of the class were sunk in the Russo-Japanese war, and the third lost during World War One."
 SOV_battleship_adv_dn:0 "Marat Class "
 SOV_battleship_adv_dn_desc:0 "The Marat class battleships (originally Gangut class) were WWI-era battleships and the first Dreadnoughts to serve in the Imperial Russian Navy. Their design and turret layout served as the basis of all the succeeding battleship and battlecruiser classes. Only three ships survived the chaos of the Russian Revolution. They were modernized and refitted during the 1930's, resulting in a tall almost pagoda-like superstructure. They had modern electronics and a strong AA complement."

 SOV_carrier_1:0 "Izmail Class"
 SOV_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Izmail class aircraft carrier was the direct conversion of the unfinished hull of her Borodino-class battlecruiser namesake. Due to the nature of conversion, the ship would have a thick armor belt and strong anti-surface and AA armament for her time. A moderately-sized air group would provide her fleet the necessary air cover. The project was not carried out due to costs and the state of the Soviet shipbuilding industry after the October Revolution."
 SOV_carrier_2:0 "Krasnyi Vozdukh"
 SOV_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Krasnyi Vozdukh-class aircraft carrier was a hypothetical design to provide the Soviet navy air projection over its fleets. They were similar in size to the British Ark Royal or Japanese Hiryu classes but carried additional secondary guns against surface targets and adequate AA guns for air cover. The increased armor results in a slightly reduced air group compared to these classes."
 SOV_carrier_3:0 "Project 71B"

Their nine 8-inch guns, 4.7 inch armoured belt and 8 inch armoured turret faces, driven at nearly 33 knots by machinery generating 107,000 hp, made them valuable units during the war."
 USA_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Baltimore Class "
 USA_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "A development from the USS Wichita (drawing strongly on the Brooklyn Class lineage), the Baltimore class were substantially larger than earlier US heavy cruisers, displacing around 14,500 tons.  With nine 8-inch guns, a strong anti-aircraft complement and robust armour arrangements, they were powerful ships."
 USA_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Des Moines Class "
 USA_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Des Moines class were a new lineage of heavy cruisers designed to mount the new rapid-fire eight inch gun that had been developed. At 17,255 tons standard, they were very large ships, but their fast-firing guns, strong armour and anti-aircraft armament also made them very powerful, with near-battleship levels of firepower."
 USA_battle_cruiser_late_ww1:0 "Lexington Class" 
 USA_battle_cruiser_late_ww1_desc:0 "The Lexington Class was initially a reaction to Japan's Kongo class battlecruiser. Ordered by the Naval Act of 1916, the ships were intended to carry 16" guns in dual turrets and be capable of 33 knots. After construction began, the US entered into the Washington Naval Treaty and the USS Lexington and USS Saratoga was converted to Carriers."
 USA_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Alaska Class "
 USA_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Alaska Class was a response to suspeccted Japanese "super cruisers." Designed to carry 12" guns and handle up to 10" shell fire, the class was capable of cruiser speeds but sacrificed under water protection."
 USA_battleship_pdn:0 "Kearsarge Class"
 USA_battleship_pdn_desc:0 "A relatively unique (but not particularly successful) design, that involved mounting 8-inch secondary guns on top of the 13-inch main armament turrets, the two ships of the Kearsarge class served through World War One, to be taken from active service in the early 1920s."
 USA_battleship_dn:0 "Delaware Class"
 USA_battleship_dn_desc:0 "The second US battleship with an 'all big-gun' armament, but the first to match the capabilities of the British ships of this type, the Delaware class had a broadside of ten 12-inch guns, a top speed of 21 knots and was well-armoured for her time. Both were scrapped as the result of the interwar naval treaties."
 USA_battleship_adv_dn:0 "New York Class "
 USA_battleship_adv_dn_desc:0 "The New York Class were the first US battleships to be armed with 14-inch/45 caliber main guns, with a broadside of ten barrels. Twenty-one 5-inch/51 guns provided secondary armament, while armour protection was robust for the time, with a belt that reached 12 inches in thickness and turret faces of 14 inches."
 #USA_battleship_1b: "Pennsylvania Class"
 #USA_battleship_1c: "New Mexico Class"
 USA_battleship_1:0 "Colorado Class "
 USA_battleship_1_desc:0 "In most respects the Colorado class resembled the previous Tennessee class ships, with a top speed of 21 knots and an armour scheme based, but improved upon, that in the far earlier Nevadas. However, the big difference was the main armament, of eight 16-inch guns, at the time of launching amongst the most powerful guns afloat."
 USA_battleship_2:0 "North Carolina Class "
 USA_battleship_2_desc:0 "The North Carolina Class was a challenging design and was the first battleship class built by the US Navy in 20 years. The US Navy required this class to meet the standards of Washington Naval Treaty, limited to 35,000 tons yet be armed with the 16"/45 caliber guns and have improved armor while being capable of escorting the US Navy's fast aircraft carriers."
 #USA_battleship_2b: "South Dakota Class"
 USA_battleship_3:0 "South Dakota Class "
 USA_battleship_3_desc:0 "The South Dakota Class was an attempt to improve resistance to shellfire from the North Carolina ships, which were designed to withstand 14-inch but not 16-inch shellfire, while still meeting a standard displacement of 35,000 tons. This was achieved by reducing the space taken up by vital equipment, leading to a cramped but still capable design."
 #USA_battleship_4:0 "Illinois Class"
 #USA_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Illinois Class continued with the design and role defined by the Iowa Class. It maintained speed and armament over armor. The Illinois Class increased the number of 16"/50 caliber guns from 9 to 12 while it also improved boilers and machinery in order to provide more efficient high cruise speeds. Like the Montana Class, initial designs included four 4 6" guns dual turrets, but this was reverted to the dual purpose 5" twin turret emplacements to maximize AA capabilities."
 USA_carrier_1:0 "Lexington Class "
 USA_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Lexington Class carrier was born from the converted hulls of two Lexington Class battlecruisers in order to conform to the limitations imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty. The class was the first operational carrier class in the US Navy as well as the largest carriers in the world at the start of the Second World War, and were instrumental in developing US carrier doctrine."
 USA_carrier_2:0 "Ranger Class "
 USA_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ranger Class was the first US Navy class designed as a carrier from the keel up. As part of a US Navy smaller carrier concept the class was much smaller than the previous Lexington Class, yet still retained a large air group compliment thanks to improvements in interior design and reductions in ship protection."
 #USA_carrier_2b: "Yorktown Class"
 #USA_carrier_2c: "Wasp Class"
 USA_carrier_3:0 "Essex Class "
 USA_carrier_3_desc:0 "With the lessons learned from the preceding Lexington, Ranger and Yorktown variant classes, the result was the Essex Class, a fast ship able to carry a large compliment of planes into battle. Damage control designs would also be carried over from the Yorktown class and a deck edge elevator was included to improve plane handling."
 USA_carrier_4:0 "Midway Class "
 USA_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Midway Class was the ultimate in US Navy carrier capability. Implementing an armored deck and able to carry far more aircraft than previous classes, the Midway Class was being given a unique sub-class designation, CVB (Carrier Vessel Battle)."
 #USA_SH_battleship_1:0 "Virginia Class"
 #USA_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "In 1920 the construction of the large South Dakota Class battleships fielding 12 x 16"/50 guns started. The class would have ushered in a new era in heavy battleship design but was cancelled in 1922 to conform to the Washington Naval Treaty. With the Treaty no longer in effect and the threat of a secret Japanese battleship project we can modernize the design, increase displacement to over 55,000 tons and up gun the design with 18"/50 caliber guns to create a new class of heavy battleship."
 #USA_SH_battleship_2:0 "Montana Class"
 #USA_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Montana Class was bigger and more armored than the Illinois Class, sacrificing speed to accommodate the increase. Its main armament of 12 x 18"/50 caliber guns and with our latest fire control system the Montana's firepower will be unmatched. Initial designs included 6" guns, but this was changed to return to the dual purpose 5" twin turret emplacements."

 ARG_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Almirante Brown Class"
 ARG_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The ship was broadly similar to the Italian Trento class but was armed with three twin 7.5-in gun turrets as against four 8-inch guns. Another important difference was the repositioning of the boilers, which gave the ship a single funnel. On trials the cruiser reached its contracted speed of 32 knots (59 km/h)."
 ARG_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "San Martín Class"

### AST - AUSTRALIA ###
 AST_submarine_ww1:0 "Improved H Class"
 AST_submarine_ww1_desc:0 "The Improved H Class submarines were medium-sized WW1 vessels, a few of which were still in service at the start of World War Two (although none in the Royal Australian Navy)."
 AST_submarine_1:0 "Oxley Class "
 AST_submarine_1_desc:0 "The Oxley Class submarines were medium-sized boats with slightly above average range, built for Australia in the 1920s.  However, they were both transferred back to Britain in 1931."
 AST_submarine_2:0 "Triton Class "
 AST_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Triton or T Class boats were designed by Britain to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war.  Australia didn't commission any submarines in the 1930s, but if she had they would likely have been of this or similar design."
 AST_submarine_3:0 "U Class "
 AST_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class Undine, Umpire and Uproar.  Australia didn't build or order any submarines of this model, but if she had, they would likely have been of this or similar design."
 AST_submarine_4:0 "A Class "
 AST_submarine_4_desc:0 "A Class submarines were large, long-range vessels designed for operations in the Pacific, with a load of 20 torpedoes and much improved diving time, radar arrangements and sound insulation compared with previous British submarines.  Australia didn't build or order any submarines of this model, but if she had, they would likely have been of this or similar design."
 AST_destroyer_early_ww1:0 "Parramatta Class"
 AST_destroyer_early_ww1_desc:0 "Acheron-class destroyers of the Royal Navy purchased by Australia, and had two 4-inch guns, two 3-inch guns and three 18-inch torpedoe tubes.  They were all out of service by the early 1930s."
 AST_destroyer_late_ww1:0 "Vendetta Class "
 AST_destroyer_late_ww1_desc:0 "Vendetta was a British late WW1 V Class destroyer.  These ships could make 34 knots, had four 4-inch guns and six trainable torpedo tubes, as well as a two-pounder pom-pom anti-aircraft gun.  While excellent destroyers for the time, they are starting to show their age by the 1930s."
 AST_destroyer_1:0 "A/B Class "
 AST_destroyer_1_desc:0 "Britain's first large destroyer class since WW1, had Australia decided to purchase new destroyers in the 1920s, it is likely that they would have ordered these vessels.  Faster and more heavily armed than the best of the WW1 destroyers, these vessels sported four 4.7-inch guns, two two-pounder anti-air guns and eight torpedo tubes, and could make 35 knots."
 AST_destroyer_2:0 "J/K/N Class "
 AST_destroyer_2_desc:0 "Known as the Nizam class in Australia, these vessels were J, K, and N class destroyers transferred from Britain.  They were armed with six 4.7 inch guns in three twin turrets, one 4 inch high-angle gun that could also perform anti-aircraft duties, as well as four 2-pounder pom-poms, four 20mm Oerlikon AA guns and four 0.5 inch machine guns, as well as 45 depth charges. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 #AST_destroyer_2b: "Arunta Class"
 AST_destroyer_3:0 "Q/R Class "
 AST_destroyer_3_desc:0 "A further development of the successful J/K/N Class design, the Q/R class further refined the design, with longer range and greater stability."
 AST_destroyer_4:0 "Tobruk Class "
 AST_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Tobruk Class destroyers were modifications (with stronger light AA armament) of the British Battle Class, built in Australia from 1946-1951. They built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war and were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels."
 #AST_destroyer_4b: "Tobruk Class"
 AST_protected_cruiser:0 "Pioneer Class"
 AST_protected_cruiser_desc:0 "Laid down in the late 19th century, these protected cruisers of the British Pelorus class were transferred to Australia in 1912 and sold in 1922.  They were armed with eight 4-inch and eight 3-pounder guns, two 18-inch torpedoes and could make 20 knots."
 AST_light_cruiser_ww1:0 "Chatham Class"
 AST_light_cruiser_ww1_desc:0 "Australia received three of Britain's Chatham Class cruisers, armed with eight 6-inch guns, two 21-inch torpedo tubes and capable of 25.5 knots, and with reasonable armour for the time.  These vessels stood the test of time, and while the last Melbourne class vessel was retired in early 1936, HMAS Adelaide, of the very similar Birmingham Class (pictured here, and built in Australia), saw service throught the Second World War and wasn't retired until 1949."
 AST_light_cruiser_1:0 "Emerald Class"
 AST_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Australia didn't purchase or build any light cruisers during the 1920s, but if they had then there's some chance they would have been similar to Britain's Emerald class.  Displacing 7300t, these were some of the largest light cruisers yet built, and at 33 knots also some of the fastest.  They had seven 6-inch guns and a relatively heavy (for the time) torpedo armament of twelve 21-inch tubes."
 #AST_light_cruiser_1c: "Sydney Class"
 AST_light_cruiser_2:0 "Perth Class "
 AST_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Perth Class, sometimes also referred to as the Amphion Class, were very similar to the British Leander Class cruisers.  They had a modern design, with the eight 6-inch guns armament in four twin turrets, a speed of 32.5 knots and eight 21-inch torpedo tubes, as well as one seaplane for scouting."
 AST_light_cruiser_3:0 "Edinburgh Class "
 AST_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Australia did not order or build any more light cruisers of this type, but if they had it is likely they would have been, or been similar to, the British Edinburgh Class.  This class was more heavily armed and armoured than the Perth Class, with four triple instead of twin turrets increasing the main armament to twelve 6-inch guns."
 AST_light_cruiser_4:0 "Neptune Class "
 AST_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "While never built, the Neptune class was a wartime British design for a light cruiser that had automatic, remote-powered 6-inch guns, advanced anti-aircraft defenses and relatively robust armour.  Had Australia built a light cruiser of this type, it is likely they would have used this or a similar design."
 AST_heavy_cruiser_ww1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 AST_heavy_cruiser_ww1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 AST_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Kent Class "
 AST_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Australia Class cruisers were the Australian orders of the British Kent class. While these vessels were, on paper, more lightly armoured than most of the heavy cruisers in other navies, they proved resilient ships, with HMAS Australia surviving five Kamikaze strikes during the war.  They were armed with eight 8-inch guns in four twin turrets, but at 31.5 knots were relatively slow for a ship in this class."
 #AST_heavy_cruiser_1b: "Canberra Class"
 AST_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class "
 AST_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they would have been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 AST_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class "
 AST_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 AST_battle_cruiser_late_ww1:0 "Renown Class "
 AST_battle_cruiser_late_ww1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 AST_battle_cruiser_1:0 "G3 Class "
 AST_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The G3-class battlecruisers were an advanced design that were never built due to the Washington Naval Treaties, but had they been constructed, would have been amongst the fastest and most heavily armoured ships of their time, with nine 16 inch guns as a main armament."
 AST_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 AST_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal was a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy with quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 AST_battleship_adv_dn:0 "Queen Elizabeth Class "
 AST_battleship_adv_dn_desc:0 "The Queen Elizabeth-class battleships were ordered under the 1912 Naval Program. These ships were the first to be equipped with 15 in. guns, and were considered the first fast battleships. They carried heavy armament for both primary and secondary roles and their thick armor made these vessels excellent warships, ideal for protecting the vast British Empire. Six ships were ordered but only five were commissioned and later modernized prior to WWII. Australia didn't order any battleships during World War 2, but if they had it's likely it would have been the same or similar to the Queen Elizabeth Class."
 AST_battleship_1:0 "Nelson Class "
 AST_battleship_1_desc:0 "The first treaty battleships, the Nelson Class were limited in their displacement, which meant they were a compromise between armour, firepower and speed.  Choosing protection over speed, they made 23 knots but due to their innovative design, were still heavily armed, with nine 16-inch guns, and very well armoured, with 14 inch belt armour and deck armour that was 6 inches thick at its thickest point.  This was made possible by placing all of the main armament forward of the bridge, shortening the armoured citadel and saving weight."
 AST_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class "
 AST_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 AST_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class "
 AST_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 AST_carrier_ww1:0 "Eagle Class "
 AST_carrier_ww1_desc:0 "The Eagle Class was the Royal Navy's first flush-decked aircraft carrier, converted from a partially-built battleship in the closing years of World War 1. As a converted vessel, its complement of around 21 aircraft was less than its displacement would otherwise have suggested, but HMS Eagle nonetheless proved a useful addition to the fleet."
 AST_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 AST_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement was limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 AST_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class "
 AST_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel was well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 AST_carrier_3:0 "Implacable Class "
 AST_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Implacable class was an improved version of the Illustrious class carriers, with a larger air wing (60 aircraft) but retaining the armoured flight deck. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."

 AST_carrier_4_desc:0 "Never completed by Britain, and never even considered by Australia, if Australia had built a 1944 type fleet carrier, it is likely to have been of this design.  The Malta class built on wartime experience to have a large hangar, supporting over 80 aircraft, strong anti-air armament and well-designed armour and damage control."

 BRA_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Marcílio Dias-class destroyers (sometimes referred to as M class, or Greenhalgh class) were three ships of the Brazilian Navy that were commissioned in 1943. They were based on the U.S. Mahan-class destroyers and were the first sizable ships built in Brazil. They displaced 1,500 tons and were armed with five 5 in./38 cal main guns."
 BRA_light_cruiser_scout:0 "Bahia Class "
 BRA_light_cruiser_scout_desc:0 "The Bahia class was a class of two British-built scout cruisers built for Brazil and delivered in 1910.

 ### CAN - CANADA ###
 CAN_submarine_ww1:0 "Improved H Class "
 CAN_submarine_ww1_desc:0 "The Improved H Class submarines were medium-sized WW1 vessels, a few of which were still in service at the start of World War Two (although none in the Royal Canadian Navy)."
 CAN_submarine_1:0 "Oberon Class "
 CAN_submarine_1_desc:0 "The Oberon was the first British patrol submarine developed in the 1920s, with intermediate range and six bow and two stern 21 inch torpedo tubes, as well as a four-inch gun. They heralded the beginning of the O, P and R class submarines that characteristed British submarine development at the time, and are the likely basis of any Canadian submarine force developed based on this model."
 CAN_submarine_2:0 "Triton Class "
 CAN_submarine_2_desc:0 "The T-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war.  Canada didn't commission any submarines in the 1930s, but if she had they would likely have been of this or similar design."
 CAN_submarine_3:0 "U Class "
 CAN_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class Undine, Umpire and Uproar.  Canada didn't build or order any submarines of this model, but if she had, they would likely have been of this or similar design."
 CAN_submarine_4:0 "A Class "
 CAN_submarine_4_desc:0 "A Class submarines were large, long-range vessels designed for operations in the Pacific, with a load of 20 torpedoes and much improved diving time, radar arrangements and sound insulation compared with previous British submarines.  Canada didn't build or order any submarines of this model, but if she had, they would likely have been of this or similar design."
 CAN_destroyer_early_ww1:0 "Patriot Class"
 CAN_destroyer_early_ww1_desc:0 "Canadian vessels from the British M class, these destroyers had three 4-inch guns, one two-pounder pom-pom and two twin 21 inch torpedo tubes.  Hard work during the First World War meant that they were out of service before the end of the 1920s."
 CAN_destroyer_late_ww1:0 "Vancouver Class "
 CAN_destroyer_late_ww1_desc:0 "Canada had two vessels from Britain's late WW1 V Class destroyers.  These ships could make 34 knots, had four 4-inch guns and six trainable torpedo tubes, as well as a two-pounder pom-pom anti-aircraft gun.  While excellent destroyers for the time, they are starting to show their age by the 1930s, and Canada scrapped both of their vessels before the Second World War began."
 CAN_destroyer_1:0 "Saguenay Class "
 CAN_destroyer_1_desc:0 "Canada purchased two A/B class destroyers from Britain, and named them Saguenay and Skeena.  They were Britain's first large destroyer class since WW1, and they were faster and more heavily armed than the best of the WW1 destroyers.  These vessels sported four 4.7-inch guns, two two-pounder anti-air guns and eight torpedo tubes, and could make 35 knots."
 #CAN_destroyer_1b: "Sanguenay Class"
 CAN_destroyer_2:0 "Gatineau Class "
 CAN_destroyer_2_desc:0 "As the Second World War continued, Canada received a number of destroyers from Britain.  Gatineau was the former Express, from the E/F class of destroyers.  These ships were used heavily on convoy escort duties, and had a strong anti-submarine weapon loadout, carrying 70 depth charges and, when it had been developed, the hedgehog anti-submarine mortar."
 #CAN_destroyer_2b: "Athabaskan Class"
 CAN_destroyer_3:0 "Algonquin Class "
 CAN_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Algonquin class were the Canadian designation for British destroyers of the S/T/U/V/W class.  These ships were multi-purpose vessels, capable of performing many tasks without specialising at one, but benefited from wartime developments in gun mountings, production techniques and anti-aircraft guns (amongst other things) making them better all-round vessels than earlier British destroyers."
 CAN_destroyer_4:0 "Crescent Class "
 CAN_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Crescent class were the Canadian designation for British Ch/Co/Cr destroyers. These ships mounted their modern 4.5 inch guns in high elevation, remote powered turrets giving them better anti-air capability than many earlier British destroyers. They also had two 40mm Bofors guns in a twin, triaxial mounting and four 21 inch torpedo tubes, as well as substantial anti-submarine weaponry."
 CAN_light_cruiser_protected:0 "Rainbow Class"
 CAN_light_cruiser_protected_desc:0 "HMCS Rainbow was an Apollo class protected cruiser built by Britain in 1893 and transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy in 1910. Rainbow was intended as a training ship, but when the First World War broke out she found herself actively patrolling the Western Pacific for German raiders.  By the end of the war she was very much out of date, and expensive to run, and was scrapped in 1920."
 CAN_light_cruiser_scout:0 "Aurora Class"
 CAN_light_cruiser_scout_desc:0 "The Aurora was a Canadian vessel from the British Arethusa class, laid down in 1912 (nt to be confused with the later Arethusa class light cruisers laid down in the 1930s). At 28.5 knots, they were relatively fast for their time, although their main armament of two 6 inch guns meant they were relatively quickly eclipsed by later cruisers of the First World War. HMCS Aurora was out of service before the end of the 1930s."
 CAN_light_cruiser_ww1:0 "Caledon Class "
 CAN_light_cruiser_ww1_desc:0 "The Caledon Class were the youngest of the excellent C-class light cruisers of the Royal Navy to serve in the Second World War. They were built during the First World War and proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. While Canada didn't have any cruisers of this model, if they had, it is likely they would have been of, or similar to, this class."
 CAN_light_cruiser_1:0 "Emerald Class "
 CAN_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Canada didn't purchase or build any light cruisers during the 1920s, but if they had then there's some chance they would have been similar to Britain's Emerald class.  Displacing 7300t, these were some of the largest light cruisers yet built, and at 33 knots also some of the fastest.  They had seven 6-inch guns and a relatively heavy (for the time) torpedo armament of twelve 21-inch tubes."
 CAN_light_cruiser_2:0 "Leander Class "
 CAN_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Leander class cruisers were built by Britain in the early 1930s as small but powerful ships designed for trade protection, designed to be well within treaty limits to allowe more ships in the class to be built. Even so, they mounted eight 6 inch guns in four twin turrets, four 4 inch dual-purpose guns and eight 21 inch torpedo tubes in two quadruple mounts, and would go on to give good service throughout the Second World War.  Canada did not have any cruisers of this model, but if she did, they could well have been of the Leander class."
 CAN_light_cruiser_3:0 "Uganda Class "
 CAN_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Canada operated one ship from the British Fiji class, the HMCS Uganda (renamed Quebec in the 1950s).  Uganda was one of the later ships in the class, and gave up one of her four triple 6 inch turrets for extra anti-aircraft armament, responding to the clear threat aircraft had proven to be during the war. Her anti-aircraft weaponry consisted of eight 4 inch QF Mk XVI guns in four twin turrets, twenty four two-pounder pom-poms and 16 20mm Oerlikon guns."
 CAN_light_cruiser_4:0 "Neptune Class "
 CAN_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "While never built, the Neptune class was a wartime British design for a light cruiser that had automatic, remote-powered 6-inch guns, advanced anti-aircraft defenses and relatively robust armour.  Had Australia built a light cruiser of this type, it is likely they would have used this or a similar design."
 CAN_heavy_cruiser_ww1:0 "Hawkins Class "
 CAN_heavy_cruiser_ww1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 CAN_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Kent Class "
 CAN_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Canada didn't build any 8 inch cruisers in the 1920s, but if they had they would likely have been based on the Kent Class developed in Britain. While these vessels were, on paper, more lightly armoured than most of the heavy cruisers in other navies, they proved resilient ships and were armed with eight 8-inch guns in four twin turrets. However, at 31.5 knots were a bit slower than a number of other 1920s heavy cruisers."
 CAN_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class "
 CAN_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they would have been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 CAN_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class "
 CAN_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 CAN_battle_cruiser_late_ww1:0 "Renown Class "
 CAN_battle_cruiser_late_ww1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 CAN_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 CAN_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal was a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy with quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 CAN_battle_cruiser_1:0 "G3 Class "
 CAN_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The British G3-class battlecruisers were an advanced design that were never built due to the Washington Naval Treaties, but had they been constructed, would have been amongst the fastest and most heavily armoured ships of their time, with nine 16 inch guns as a main armament.  Had Canada developed the capabilities to build a ship of this type, it would likely have based it on the British design."
 CAN_battleship_adv_dn:0 "Queen Elizabeth Class "
 CAN_battleship_adv_dn_desc:0 "The Queen Elizabeth-class battleships were ordered under the 1912 Naval Program. These ships were the first to be equipped with 15 in. guns, and were considered the first fast battleships. They carried heavy armament for both primary and secondary roles and their thick armor made these vessels excellent warships, ideal for protecting the vast British Empire. Six ships were ordered but only five were commissioned and later modernized prior to WWII."
 CAN_battleship_1:0 "Nelson Class "
 CAN_battleship_1_desc:0 "The first treaty battleships, the Nelson Class were limited in their displacement, which meant they were a compromise between armour, firepower and speed.  Choosing protection over speed, they made 23 knots but due to their innovative design, were still heavily armed, with nine 16-inch guns, and very well armoured, with 14 inch belt armour and deck armour that was 6 inches thick at its thickest point.  This was made possible by placing all of the main armament forward of the bridge, shortening the armoured citadel and saving weight."
 CAN_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class "
 CAN_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 CAN_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class "
 CAN_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 CAN_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 CAN_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion was a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 CAN_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 CAN_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 CAN_carrier_ww1:0 "Eagle Class "
 CAN_carrier_ww1_desc:0 "The Eagle Class was the Royal Navy's first flush-decked aircraft carrier, converted from a partially-built battleship in the closing years of World War 1. As a converted vessel, its complement of around 21 aircraft was less than its displacement would otherwise have suggested, but HMS Eagle nonetheless proved a useful addition to the fleet."
 CAN_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 CAN_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement was limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 CAN_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class "
 CAN_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel was well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 CAN_carrier_3:0 "Implacable Class "
 CAN_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Implacable class was an improved version of the Illustrious class carriers, with a larger air wing (60 aircraft) but retaining the armoured flight deck. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 CAN_carrier_4:0 "Malta Class "
 CAN_carrier_4_desc:0 "Never completed by Britain, and never even considered by Canada, if Canada had built a 1944 type fleet carrier, it is likely to have been of this design.  The Malta class built on wartime experience to have a large hangar, supporting over 80 aircraft, strong anti-air armament and well-designed armour and damage control."
 ### CHI - NATIONALIST CHINA ###
 CHI_destroyer_tb:0 "Tse Chiang Class "
 CHI_destroyer_tb_desc:0 "The Tse Chiang (formerly known as Chien Wei) class were torpedo gunboats built for the Nationalist Chinese navy and commissioned in 1903. Two ships of the class were modernized and still in service at the time of the Japanese invasion. Once modernized, they displaced 870 tons and were armed with two 4.7 in. main guns, but were only capable of 12 knots speed."
 CHI_light_cruiser_protected:0 "Hai Yung Class "
 CHI_light_cruiser_protected_desc:0 "The Hai Yung class comprised three protected cruisers built for China in the late 1890s by Germany. The ships were similar to other protected cruisers and subsequent light cruisers produced for China around the turn of the century. Hai Yung displaced just under 2,700 tons and were armed with three 5.9 in QF guns."
 CHI_light_cruiser_1:0 "Ning Hai Class "
 CHI_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Comfortably the most modern ship in the Chinese Navy in 1936, the Ning Hai was built in Japan for China in the early 1930s, while her sister, Ping Hai, was being built in China with German assistance. They were very small and slow for light cruisers, as well as lightly armoured, but had a very respectable main armament of six 140mm guns on just 2500t displacement."
 CHI_armoured_cruiser_1:0 "Hai Chi Class "
 CHI_armoured_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hai Chi class were built for China by Britain in the late 1890s, and were armed with two 8 inch guns as main armament and ten 4.7 inch secondaries. Thoroughly obsolete by the mid-1930s, these ships had been laid up and were only brought back into service as blockships when Japan attacked."
 ### CHL - CHILE ###
 CHL_submarine_ww1:0 "H Class "
 CHL_submarine_ww1_desc:0 "These submarines were a set of six British H-class, or Holland 602, submarines built in the U.K. and transferred to Chile shortly after World War I in return for submarines interred during the war. The ships were built between 1915 and 1918. They displaced over 360 tons, had a diving depth of 30m, and were armed with four 450mm torpedo tubes."
 CHL_submarine_1:0 "Capitán O`Brien Class "
 CHL_submarine_1_desc:0 "Made in Britain for Chile, the Capitán O`Brien class were modified British O class boats, weight 1540 tons surfaced. They had eight 21 inch torpedo tubes (6 in the bow, 2 in the stern), and mounted a 4.7 inch gun. They were easily recognised by their large conning tower. These submarines entered service in 1929."
 #CHL_submarine_1b: "Capitán O`Brien Class"
 CHL_destroyer_late_ww1:0 "Almirante Lynch Class "
 CHL_destroyer_late_ww1_desc:0 "The Almirante Lynch-class destroyers were a group of six ships built for the Chilean Navy in the U.K. just before World War I. Only two ships were delivered before the outbreak of war and served until 1945. They were very large for pre-WW1 destroyers, and more closely resembled those at the end of the conflict. They displaced 1,430 tons, had decent speed and range for their vintage, and were armed with six 4 in. L/40 QF Mark VI main guns and two 21 in. torpedo tubes."
 CHL_destroyer_1:0 "Serrano Class "
 CHL_destroyer_1_desc:0 "Chile's six Serrano class destroyers were built by Britain for Chile in the late 1920s, incorporating the latest British design features, but on a somewhat smaller displacement of 1090 tons standard. Accordingly, they only had three 4.7 inch guns and six 21 inch torpedo tubes. They were decent ships, but were too lightly built for operations in the turbulent waters off Chile's south coast."
 #CHL_destroyer_1b: "Serrano Class"
 #CHL_light_cruiser_1:0 "Chacabuco Class"
 #CHL_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Chacabuco was a protected cruiser that was built in Britain and commissioned for the Chilean Navy in 1902. It displaced 4,160 tons and was armed with two Armstrong 8 in. main guns and three 18 in. torpedo tubes. It was slow but well-armored compared to early light cruisers."
 CHL_armoured_cruiser_1:0 "O'Higgins Class "
 CHL_armoured_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The O'Higgins was an armored cruiser built at the turn of the 20th century in Britain for the Chilean Navy. It displaced 7,800 tons, had four 8 in. and 45 caliber guns as its main armament, but was fairly slow compared to the heavy cruisers built following World War I."
 CHL_battleship_adv_dn:0 "Almirante Latorre Class "
 CHL_battleship_adv_dn_desc:0 "The Almirante Latorre class consisted of two super-dreadnought battleships built in Britain for the Chilean Navy at the outbreak of World War I. Only one was finished as a battleship, with the other being converted to the HMS Eagle aircraft carrier. The ships displaced over 28,000 tons and had a main armament of ten 14 in./45 caliber BL guns. They were less armored but somewhat faster than other dreadnoughts of their era."
 ### COL - COLOMBIA ###
 COL_destroyer_1:0 "Antioquia Class "
 COL_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Antioquia class consisted of two destroyers built for the Columbian Navy in Portugal to a British design. The ships were commissioned in 1934. They displaced over 1,200 tons and were armed with four BL 4.7 in. guns and eight 533mm torpedo tubes."
 ### DEN - DENMARK ###
 #DEN_submarine_ww1:0 "Rota Class "
 #DEN_submarine_ww1_desc:0 "Rota class submarines were built and commissioned in Denmark following the end of World War I. They were small subs and were based on the Holland 602 design. They displaced 290 tons and were armed with four 450mm torpedo tubes."
 DEN_submarine_1:0 "Daphne Class "
 DEN_submarine_1_desc:0 "A class of two small coastal submarines built in Denmark during the mid-1920s, these vessels displaced a little over 300 tons, but still had six 450mm torpedo tubes (four in the bow, two in the stern), a 75mm deck gun and a 20mm AA gun."
 DEN_submarine_2:0 "Havmanden Class "
 DEN_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Havmanden class consisted of five planned submarines. Three were completed before the German occupation, one was completed during the occupation, and the fifth was cancelled. The subs were fairly small, displacing 320 tons. They were armed with five 450mm torpedo tubes, two 20mm AA guns and two 8mm machine guns."
 DEN_submarine_3:0 "Sirene Class"
 DEN_submarine_4:0 "Støren Class"
 DEN_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Støren was a British Vampire-class submarine transferred to the Danish Navy after the war. The ship was relatively small, displacing 545 tons, but had four 533mm torpedo tubes and good seagoing ability."
 DEN_destroyer_1:0 "Grønsund Class"
 DEN_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Grønsund Class gunboats were commsioned in 1883, but were updated to match the times. Their main job was to protect fishing vessels and convoys. The original Grønsund gunboat had a displacement of about 250 tons, a top speed of 11.6 knots, and two 57mm Guns as its main armament along with a 40cm searchlight. This class of ship would serve all the way until 1950."
 DEN_destroyer_2:0 "Hvidbjørnen Class"
 DEN_destroyer_2_desc:0 "Built in 1928 the Hvidbjørnen was built as fishery protection ship, a class unique to the Danish navy. With two 87mm guns, two 90cm Searchlights and a displacement of 914 tons, the Hvidbjørnen was no Bismarck, but it could certainly fight. Scuttled in 1943, the ship would be salvaged by the Germans and would serve them beyond WWII as a part of the East German Navy."
 DEN_destroyer_3:0 "Hunt Class"
 DEN_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Hunt Class destroyer was a series of ships built by Great Britain between 1939 and 1943. After the war Britain would sell one of these ships, the HMS Blackmore to Denmark who would rename it the HDMS Esbern Snare, where it would remain until it was decommissioned in 1965. The Esbern Snare was 85.34m (280ft) long and had a full displacement of 1,490 tons. Its main armament consisted of six QF 4in Mark XVI and six Thornycraft depth charge throwers."
 DEN_destroyer_4:0 "Huitfeldt Class"

 NOR_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Uredd class consisted of two British U-class submarines built for the Norwegian Navy in exile between 1941 and 1943. The ships displaced 540 tons and were armed with four 533mm torpedo tubes. They had a good complement of British radar and sonar, and a diving depth of 60m."
 NOR_submarine_4:0 "Utsira Class"
 NOR_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Utsira class consisted of four British Vampire-class submarines. They were built between 1943 and 1944, though only one was transferred to the Norwegian Navy in exile before the end of the war. The ships were only a moderate improvement over the preceding U-class. They displaced 545 tons, were armed with four 533mm torpedo tubes, and a diving depth of 90m."
 #NOR_destroyer_tb:0 "Draug Class "
 #NOR_destroyer_tb_desc :0 "The four Draug-class destroyers were the first multi-vessel class of destroyers built for the Royal Norwegian Navy. They were commissioned just before World War I and displaced 580 tons. They were armed with three 3 in. British QF guns in their main armament. They were fairly slow, however, even compared to other destroyers of their vintage."
 NOR_destroyer_1:0 "Sleipner Class" #DNM - Sleipner is a TB in DNM.
 NOR_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Sleipner class was a class of large torpedo boats built in Norway for the Royal Norwegian Navy and commissioned between 1937 and 1939. Unlike the earlier Draug class, the Sleipner class had relatively good armament and ASW equipment. The displaced 735 tons and had decent speed for their size."
 NOR_destroyer_2:0 "Ålesund Class "
 NOR_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Ålesund class consisted of two destroyers laid down in 1939 but never completed before the German occupation. Had they been completed, they would have been the first Norwegian destroyers that were comparable in size to the destroyers of most major nations, displacing over 1,200 tons. They were to be armed with four 120mm/40 Bofors cannon in their armament and four 533mm torpedo tubes."
 NOR_destroyer_3:0 "Stord Class"
 NOR_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Stord class consisted of four British S-class destroyers built for the Royal Norwegian Navy in exile between 1943 and 1944. They displaced nearly 1,800 tons and were armed with four 120mm/45 QF Mk IX guns in their main armament, as well as eight 533mm torpedo tubes and a decent ASW and radar complement. They also had good speed and reliability as well."
 NOR_destroyer_4:0 "Oslo Class"
 NOR_destroyer_4_desc:0 "This class of four destroyers, built in Britain but transferrred to Norway prior to completion, were Cr-class vessels with modern, dual-purpose main armament with remote power control and capable of blind-firing with the use of radar. However, fitting this on a relatively light displacement for a late-war destroyer (1,825 tons standard) meant a reduced torpedo and anti-submarine loadout."
 #NOR_light_cruiser_protected:0 "Frithjof Class"
 #NOR_light_cruiser_protected_desc:0 "A very small (1,360 tons normal displacement) protected cruiser, the Frithjof class was built domestically, commissioning in 1896 and serving both as a warship and then training ship until 1928, when she was stricken from the Norwegian Navy. Her main armament were two 120mm guns, backed up by four 76mm guns."
 #NOR_armoured_cruiser_1:0 "Norge Class "
 #NOR_armoured_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Norge was a coastal defense ship built for Norway in Britain at the turn of the century. Its armament, which centered around two 210mm guns, was comparable to a heavy cruiser, though its size, which displaced just over 4,200 tons, was closer to a light cruiser. Its speed was comparable to a dreadnought battleship. It was one of four coastal defense ships of its era that was still serving the Royal Norwegian Navy at the start of World War II."
 NOR_light_cruiser_1:0 "Heimdal Class"
 NOR_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Launched in 1892 the Heimdael served a variety of roles over its lengthy career, including fishery protection, royal yacht, and cargo. Displacing 526 tons, the Heimdal would be upgraded in 1921 to have 4 x 76mm guns and 2 x 37mm guns."
 NOR_light_cruiser_2:0 "Fridtjof Nansen Class"
 NOR_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Fridtjof Nansen was the first ship built by Norway for the specific purpose of coastal defence and fishery protection. She displaced 1,275 tons and had 2 x cm guns along with 2 x 47mm automatic guns. The Fridtjof Nansen would escape from Norway after its conquest, but would shortly thereafter run aground on an unmarked shallow off of the coast of Jan Mayen, sinking immediately. All 67 crew would survive to be transported back to Iceland."

 ### NZL - NEW ZEALAND ###
 NZL_submarine_ww1:0 "Improved H Class "
 NZL_submarine_ww1_desc:0 "The Improved H Class submarines were medium-sized WW1 vessels, a few of which were still in service at the start of World War Two (although none in the Royal Canadian Navy)."
 NZL_submarine_1:0 "Oberon Class "
 NZL_submarine_1_desc:0 "The Oberon was the first British patrol submarine developed in the 1920s, with intermediate range and six bow and two stern 21 inch torpedo tubes, as well as a four-inch gun. They heralded the beginning of the O, P and R class submarines that characteristed British submarine development at the time, and are the likely basis of any Canadian submarine force developed based on this model."
 NZL_submarine_2:0 "Triton Class "
 NZL_submarine_2_desc:0 "The T-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war.  New Zealand didn't commission any submarines in the 1930s, but if she had they would likely have been of this or similar design."
 NZL_submarine_3:0 "U Class "
 NZL_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class Undine, Umpire and Uproar.  New Zealand didn't build or order any submarines of this model, but if she had, they would likely have been of this or similar design."
 NZL_submarine_4:0 "A Class "
 NZL_submarine_4_desc:0 "A Class submarines were large, long-range vessels designed for operations in the Pacific, with a load of 20 torpedoes and much improved diving time, radar arrangements and sound insulation compared with previous British submarines.  New Zealand didn't build or order any submarines of this model, but if she had, they would likely have been of this or similar design."
 NZL_destroyer_late_ww1:0 "V Class "
 NZL_destroyer_late_ww1_desc:0 "The V class destroyers were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 NZL_destroyer_1:0 "A/B Class "
 NZL_destroyer_1_desc:0 "Britain's first large destroyer class since WW1, had New Zealand decided to purchase new destroyers in the 1920s, it is likely that they would have ordered these vessels.  Faster and more heavily armed than the best of the WW1 destroyers, these vessels sported four 4.7-inch guns, two two-pounder anti-air guns and eight torpedo tubes, and could make 35 knots."
 NZL_destroyer_2:0 "E/F Class "
 NZL_destroyer_2_desc:0 "A more advanced British interwar destroyer, these ships had more efficient machinery but similar armament to preceding classes.  These ships were used heavily on convoy escort duties, and had a strong anti-submarine weapon loadout, carrying 70 depth charges and, when it had been developed, the hedgehog anti-submarine mortar."
 NZL_destroyer_3:0 "L/M Class "
 NZL_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The L/M class destroyers were enlarged versions of the preceding J/K/N class, but with a more advanced and powerful 4.7 inch gun (the 4.7 inch QF Mk XI) which, with 50 degrees of elevation, allowed for a measure of use against aircraft as well as surface vessels.  As with most Second World War British destroyer designs, these vessels had large depth charge armaments."
 NZL_destroyer_4:0 "Battle Class "
 NZL_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war. The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 NZL_light_cruiser_protected:0 "Philomel Class"
 NZL_light_cruiser_protected_desc:0 "The protected cruiser Philomel was completed in 1891 for Australia, as part of a class of five, but was transferred to New Zealand in 1914, and was still in New Zealand service as a base ship in World War 2 (although completely irrelevant from a combat perspective at this time)."
 NZL_light_cruiser_ww1:0 "Dunedin Class "
 NZL_light_cruiser_ww1_desc:0 "The Dunedin class were the New Zealand name for the British Danae class ships, improved versions of the excellent British C-class light cruisers. These vessels, like their predecessors gave valuable service in the Second World War despite being built in World War One. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. Two ships of this class served with the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy from 1925 onwards."
 NZL_light_cruiser_1:0 "Emerald Class "
 NZL_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "New Zealand didn't purchase or build any light cruisers during the 1920s, but if they had then there's some chance they would have been similar to Britain's Emerald class.  Displacing 7300t, these were some of the largest light cruisers yet built, and at 33 knots also some of the fastest.  They had seven 6-inch guns and a relatively heavy (for the time) torpedo armament of twelve 21-inch tubes."
 NZL_light_cruiser_2:0 "Leander Class "
 NZL_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Leander class cruisers were built by Britain in the early 1930s as small but powerful ships designed for trade protection, designed to be well within treaty limits to allowe more ships in the class to be built. Even so, they mounted eight 6 inch guns in four twin turrets, four 4 inch dual-purpose guns and eight 21 inch torpedo tubes in two quadruple mounts, and would go on to give good service throughout the Second World War."
 NZL_light_cruiser_3:0 "Gambia Class "
 NZL_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Gambia class was the New Zealand designation for British Crown Colony-class light cruisers. These were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range was somewhat reduced."
 NZL_light_cruiser_4:0 "Neptune Class "
 NZL_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "While never built, the Neptune class was a wartime British design for a light cruiser that had automatic, remote-powered 6-inch guns, advanced anti-aircraft defenses and relatively robust armour.  Had Australia built a light cruiser of this type, it is likely they would have used this or a similar design."
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_ww1:0 "Hawkins Class "
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_ww1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Kent Class "
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "New Zealand didn't build any 8 inch cruisers in the 1920s, but if they had they would likely have been based on the Kent Class developed in Britain. While these vessels were, on paper, more lightly armoured than most of the heavy cruisers in other navies, they proved resilient ships and were armed with eight 8-inch guns in four twin turrets. However, at 31.5 knots were a bit slower than a number of other 1920s heavy cruisers."
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class "
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they would have been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class "
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels would have had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 NZL_battle_cruiser_late_ww1:0 "Renown Class "
 NZL_battle_cruiser_late_ww1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 NZL_battle_cruiser_1:0 "G3 Class "
 NZL_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The British G3-class battlecruisers were an advanced design that were never built due to the Washington Naval Treaties, but had they been constructed, would have been amongst the fastest and most heavily armoured ships of their time, with nine 16 inch guns as a main armament.  Had New Zealand developed the capabilities to build a ship of this type, it would likely have based it on the British design."
 NZL_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 NZL_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal was a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 NZL_battleship_adv_dn:0 "Queen Elizabeth Class "
 NZL_battleship_adv_dn_desc:0 "The Queen Elizabeth-class battleships were ordered under the 1912 Naval Program. These ships were the first to be equipped with 15 in. guns, and were considered the first fast battleships. They carried heavy armament for both primary and secondary roles and their thick armor made these vessels excellent warships, ideal for protecting the vast British Empire. Six ships were ordered but only five were commissioned and later modernized prior to WWII."
 NZL_battleship_1:0 "Nelson Class "
 NZL_battleship_1_desc:0 "The first treaty battleships, the Nelson Class were limited in their displacement, which meant they were a compromise between armour, firepower and speed.  Choosing protection over speed, they made 23 knots but due to their innovative design, were still heavily armed, with nine 16-inch guns, and very well armoured, with 14 inch belt armour and deck armour that was 6 inches thick at its thickest point.  This was made possible by placing all of the main armament forward of the bridge, shortening the armoured citadel and saving weight."
 NZL_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class "
 NZL_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 NZL_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class "
 NZL_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 NZL_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 NZL_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion was a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 NZL_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 NZL_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 NZL_carrier_ww1:0 "Eagle Class "
 NZL_carrier_ww1_desc:0 "The Eagle Class was the Royal Navy's first flush-decked aircraft carrier, converted from a partially-built battleship in the closing years of World War 1. As a converted vessel, its complement of around 21 aircraft was less than its displacement would otherwise have suggested, but HMS Eagle nonetheless proved a useful addition to the fleet."
 NZL_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 NZL_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement was limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 NZL_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class "
 NZL_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel was well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 NZL_carrier_3:0 "Implacable Class "
 NZL_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Implacable class was an improved version of the Illustrious class carriers, with a larger air wing (60 aircraft) but retaining the armoured flight deck. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 NZL_carrier_4:0 "Malta Class "
 NZL_carrier_4_desc:0 "Never completed by Britain, and never even considered by New Zealand, if New Zealand had built a 1944 type fleet carrier, it is likely to have been of this design.  The Malta class built on wartime experience to have a large hangar, supporting over 80 aircraft, strong anti-air armament and well-designed armour and damage control."

 RAJ_submarine_2_desc:0 "The T-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war.  India didn't commission any submarines in the 1930s, but if she had they would likely have been of this or similar design."
 RAJ_submarine_3:0 "U Class "
 RAJ_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class Undine, Umpire and Uproar.  India didn't build or order any submarines of this model, but if she had, they would likely have been of this or similar design."
 RAJ_submarine_4:0 "A Class "
 RAJ_submarine_4_desc:0 "A Class submarines were large, long-range vessels designed for operations in the Pacific, with a load of 20 torpedoes and much improved diving time, radar arrangements and sound insulation compared with previous British submarines.  India didn't build or order any submarines of this model, but if she had, they would likely have been of this or similar design."
 RAJ_destroyer_late_ww1:0 "V Class "
 RAJ_destroyer_late_ww1_desc:0 "The V class destroyers were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 RAJ_destroyer_1:0 "A/B Class "
 RAJ_destroyer_1_desc:0 "Britain's first large destroyer class since WW1, had India decided to purchase new destroyers in the 1920s, it is likely that they would have ordered these vessels.  Faster and more heavily armed than the best of the WW1 destroyers, these vessels sported four 4.7-inch guns, two two-pounder anti-air guns and eight torpedo tubes, and could make 35 knots."
 RAJ_destroyer_2:0 "E/F Class "
 RAJ_destroyer_2_desc:0 "A more advanced British interwar destroyer, these ships had more efficient machinery but similar armament to preceding classes.  These ships were used heavily on convoy escort duties, and had a strong anti-submarine weapon loadout, carrying 70 depth charges and, when it had been developed, the hedgehog anti-submarine mortar."
 RAJ_destroyer_3:0 "L/M Class "
 RAJ_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The L/M class destroyers were enlarged versions of the preceding J/K/N class, but with a more advanced and powerful 4.7 inch gun (the 4.7 inch QF Mk XI) which, with 50 degrees of elevation, allowed for a measure of use against aircraft as well as surface vessels.  As with most Second World War British destroyer designs, these vessels had large depth charge armaments."
 RAJ_destroyer_4:0 "Battle Class "
 RAJ_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 RAJ_light_cruiser_ww1:0 "Caledon Class "
 RAJ_light_cruiser_ww1_desc:0 "The Caledon Class were the youngest of the excellent C-class light cruisers of the Royal Navy to serve in the Second World War. They were built during the First World War and proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys."
 RAJ_light_cruiser_1:0 "Emerald Class "
 RAJ_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "India didn't purchase or build any light cruisers during the 1920s, but if they had then there's some chance they would have been similar to Britain's Emerald class.  Displacing 7300t, these were some of the largest light cruisers yet built, and at 33 knots also some of the fastest.  They had seven 6-inch guns and a relatively heavy (for the time) torpedo armament of twelve 21-inch tubes."
 RAJ_light_cruiser_2:0 "Leander Class "
 RAJ_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Leander class cruisers were built by Britain in the early 1930s as small but powerful ships designed for trade protection, designed to be well within treaty limits to allowe more ships in the class to be built. Even so, they mounted eight 6 inch guns in four twin turrets, four 4 inch dual-purpose guns and eight 21 inch torpedo tubes in two quadruple mounts, and would go on to give good service throughout the Second World War."
 RAJ_light_cruiser_3:0 "Edinburgh Class "
 RAJ_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Edinburgh class were improved versions of the earlier Southhampton class. The ships carried the same main armament as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in guns, but they had improved ammunition handling, stronger anti-aircraft armament and an improved armour scheme."
 RAJ_light_cruiser_4:0 "Neptune Class "
 RAJ_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "While never built, the Neptune class was a wartime British design for a light cruiser that had automatic, remote-powered 6-inch guns, advanced anti-aircraft defenses and relatively robust armour.  Had Australia built a light cruiser of this type, it is likely they would have used this or a similar design."
 RAJ_heavy_cruiser_ww1:0 "Hawkins Class "
 RAJ_heavy_cruiser_ww1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 RAJ_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Kent Class "
 RAJ_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "India didn't build or buy any 8 inch cruisers in the 1920s, but if they had they would likely have been based on the Kent Class developed in Britain. While these vessels were, on paper, more lightly armoured than most of the heavy cruisers in other navies, they proved resilient ships and were armed with eight 8-inch guns in four twin turrets. However, at 31.5 knots were a bit slower than a number of other 1920s heavy cruisers."
 RAJ_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class "
 RAJ_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they would have been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 RAJ_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class "
 RAJ_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 RAJ_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 RAJ_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels would have had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 RAJ_battle_cruiser_late_ww1:0 "Renown Class "
 RAJ_battle_cruiser_late_ww1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 RAJ_battle_cruiser_1:0 "G3 Class "
 RAJ_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The British G3-class battlecruisers were an advanced design that were never built due to the Washington Naval Treaties, but had they been constructed, would have been amongst the fastest and most heavily armoured ships of their time, with nine 16 inch guns as a main armament.  Had India developed the capabilities to build a ship of this type, it would likely have based it on the British design."
 RAJ_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 RAJ_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal was a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 RAJ_battleship_adv_dn:0 "Queen Elizabeth Class "
 RAJ_battleship_adv_dn_desc:0 "The Queen Elizabeth-class battleships were ordered under the 1912 Naval Program. These ships were the first to be equipped with 15 in. guns, and were considered the first fast battleships. They carried heavy armament for both primary and secondary roles and their thick armor made these vessels excellent warships, ideal for protecting the vast British Empire. Six ships were ordered but only five were commissioned and later modernized prior to WWII."
 RAJ_battleship_1:0 "Nelson Class "
 RAJ_battleship_1_desc:0 "The first treaty battleships, the Nelson Class were limited in their displacement, which meant they were a compromise between armour, firepower and speed.  Choosing protection over speed, they made 23 knots but due to their innovative design, were still heavily armed, with nine 16-inch guns, and very well armoured, with 14 inch belt armour and deck armour that was 6 inches thick at its thickest point.  This was made possible by placing all of the main armament forward of the bridge, shortening the armoured citadel and saving weight."
 RAJ_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class "
 RAJ_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 RAJ_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class "
 RAJ_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 RAJ_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 RAJ_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion was a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 RAJ_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 RAJ_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 RAJ_carrier_ww1:0 "Eagle Class "
 RAJ_carrier_ww1_desc:0 "The Eagle Class was the Royal Navy's first flush-decked aircraft carrier, converted from a partially-built battleship in the closing years of World War 1. As a converted vessel, its complement of around 21 aircraft was less than its displacement would otherwise have suggested, but HMS Eagle nonetheless proved a useful addition to the fleet."
 RAJ_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 RAJ_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement was limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 RAJ_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class "
 RAJ_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel was well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 RAJ_carrier_3:0 "Implacable Class "
 RAJ_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Implacable class was an improved version of the Illustrious class carriers, with a larger air wing (60 aircraft) but retaining the armoured flight deck. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 RAJ_carrier_4:0 "Malta Class "
 RAJ_carrier_4_desc:0 "Never completed by Britain, and never even considered by India, if India had built a 1944 type fleet carrier, it is likely to have been of this design.  The Malta class built on wartime experience to have a large hangar, supporting over 80 aircraft, strong anti-air armament and well-designed armour and damage control."

 ROM_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Requinul and Marsuinul submarines were built by the Germans for their Romanian allies. They were commissioned in 1943. The ships were based on the German Type VII submarines. The ships were medium-sized submarines, displacing 600 tons, and were armed with six 533mm torpedo tubes."
 ROM_destroyer_late_ww1:0 "Mărăsti Class "
 ROM_destroyer_late_ww1_desc:0 "The Mărăsti class was a class of destroyers built for Romania during World War I. The four ships of the class were requisitioned by the Italian Navy during the war, and two were eventually sold to Romania in the early 1920s. They were larger destroyers, displacing over 1,400 tons. They were armed with four 120mm/45 Schneider-Canet-Armstrong guns and four 450mm torpedo tubes. They had average speed and reliability for their vintage."
 ROM_destroyer_1:0 "Regele Ferdinand Class "
 ROM_destroyer_1_desc:0 "Built in Italy to a mainly British design, these two destroyers were Romania's most modern surface warships when World War Two broke out. Armed with five 120mm guns, six 533mm torpedo tubes and with a top speed of 37 knots, these were capable destroyers (and were the most capable Axis warships in the Black Sea throughout the war)."

She was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel was well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 SAF_carrier_3:0 "Implacable Class "
 SAF_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Implacable class was an improved version of the Illustrious class carriers, with a larger air wing (60 aircraft) but retaining the armoured flight deck. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 SAF_carrier_4:0 "Malta Class "
 SAF_carrier_4_desc:0 "Never completed by Britain, and never even considered by South Africa, if South Africa had built a 1944 type fleet carrier, it is likely to have been of this design.  The Malta class built on wartime experience to have a large hangar, supporting over 80 aircraft, strong anti-air armament and well-designed armour and damage control."

 SIA_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Taksin class consisted of a pair of light cruisers ordered by Siam from Italy. They were partially completed when they were seized by Italy for its war effort in 1942. In their original design, they would have displaced 5,900 tons and been armed with six 152mm/53 OTO 1929 guns in their main armament. They would have had decent armor but been very slow for a modern cruiser."
 SIA_light_cruiser_1:0 "Sri Ayudhaya Class "
 SIA_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Sri Ayudhaya class coastal defense ships were perhaps the last ships of this type built in the world, with both ships of the class built in Japan and commissioned for the Royal Thai Navy in 1938. Not cruisers in any sense beyond weaponry, they fit best into the vanilla game classes as a heavily varianted light cruiser, but will be a large gunship in a future iteration of the TWAS mod."

 ### VIC - VICHY FRANCE ###
 VIC_submarine_1:0 "600 Series"
 VIC_submarine_1_desc:0 "The 600-ton Series of submarines were France's first modern post WWI submarines. They were medium sized displacing around 600tons though they were seagoing ones, they were designated as coastal submarines and used mostly in the warm waters of the Mediterranean. Three classes of four ships were each built of this type: Sirène, Ariane and Circé classes. They were the basis of the bigger 630-ton Series the Argonaute, Diane and Orion classes."
 #VIC_submarine_1b: "630 Series"
 #VIC_submarine_1c: "Redoutable Class"
 VIC_submarine_2:0 "Minerve Class"
 VIC_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Minerve-class submarines (Project name T2) were based on the 630-ton Series though they had better engines and different torpedo layout. These submarines were the first part of the standardization program resulting of a centralized design of the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale), a rather specific shipyard design of the previous classes."
 #VIC_submarine_2b: "Aurore Class"
 VIC_submarine_3:0 "Roland Morillot Class"
 VIC_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Roland Morillot-class submarines (Project name Z2) were large ocean-going submarines based on the earlier Redoubtable-class submarines. They were large submarines displacing 1,800-2,400 tons and carried a formidable armament of 10 torpedo tubes. The Fall of France occurred before any were finished."
 VIC_submarine_4:0 "Phénix Class"
 VIC_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Phénix-class submarines were medium sized ocean-going and long range boats authorized in the 1939-40 naval programs but the start of the war and the Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these boats. They were similar to the Redoutable class though they were smaller and displaced 1,200 tons. They carried a similarly heavy torpedo armament."
 VIC_destroyer_1:0 "Bourrasque Class"
 VIC_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Bourrasque-class destroyers were part of the 1,500-ton Series, and launched in the mid 1920's. Together with the preceding Chacal and following L'Adroit classes, they were the backbone of the new modern post war French fleet. They were fast and well-armed for their time, but their torpedo armament was smaller compared to similar vessels in the other navies."
 #VIC_destroyer_1b: "Chacal Class"
 #VIC_destroyer_1c: "Aigle & Vauquelin Class"
 VIC_destroyer_2:0 "Le Fantasque Class"
 VIC_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Le Fantasque-class destroyers were essentially improved versions of the earlier super destroyers of the 2,400-ton Series (Guépard, Aigle, Vauquelin) built under the 1930 naval program. They were large, heavily-armed, and very fast destroyers, perfect for escorting the new high speed units of the French fleet. Their armament consisted of newly developed guns, adequate AA, and torpedo armament."
 #VIC_destroyer_2b: "Le Hardi Class"
 #VIC_destroyer_2c: "Mogador Class"
 VIC_destroyer_3:0 "L'Intrépide Class"
 VIC_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The L'Intrépide-class destroyers were a modified version of the earlier Le Hardi class destroyers. They were authorized in the 1938 and 1939 naval programs but the war and Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these vessels. They would have been focused more on an anti-aircraft role, with an increase in displacement to 2,800-2,900 tons and larger engines."
 VIC_destroyer_4:0 "Hoche Class"
 VIC_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Hoche and Bayard classes were the final super destroyer design of the French Navy. Both classes were based on the Mogador class, displacing 4,200 tons with a similar main armament but improved AA guns and stronger engines. They were authorized in the 1939-40 naval programs but the start of the war and the Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these ships."
 VIC_light_cruiser_1:0 "Duguay-Trouin Class"
 VIC_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Duguay-Trouin light cruisers were the first major French warships built after World War I in the 1922 naval program. They became the first light cruisers with super-firing enclosed main turrets. Among light cruisers, they had a strong torpedo armament but virtually nonexistent armor."
 VIC_light_cruiser_2:0 "La Galissonnière Class"
 VIC_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The La Galissonnière-class light cruisers were the answer to the Italian Condottieri type light cruisers and were based on the previous Emile Bertin class. They were built in the 1931 and 1932 naval programs, with typical main armament and adequate AA armament of the era. They displaced 10,850 tons, had an increased amount of scout planes, and had good speed."
 VIC_light_cruiser_3:0 "De Grasse Class"
 VIC_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The DeGrasse-class cruisers were authorized in the 1938 and 1939 naval programs and were essentially improved La Galissonnières. They had stronger AA armament, as well as bigger engines. The Fall of France caused the last two ships to be cancelled and the lead ship to be finished post-war as a different design. The Germans intended to finish her as a light carrier but this project was also not carried out."
 VIC_light_cruiser_4:0 "Colbert Class"
 VIC_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Colbert was an anti-aircraft light cruiser launched in 1956. This Colbert-class cruiser was built in a very similar way to the post-war De Grasse, featuring heavy AA armament both for long and short ranges. The difference between Colbert and DeGrasse was that the Colbert had smaller engines, thinner armor, and was slightly smaller."
 VIC_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Suffren Class"
 VIC_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Suffren-class heavy cruisers were basically a repeat of the previous Duquesne class with minor improvements regarding its seagoing abilities. Both classes resembled the contemporary cruiser philosophy of the French navy: very thin armor but good speed and range. Their standard displacement is 10,000 tons and they were equipped with armaments that were standard for a heavy cruiser."
 VIC_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Algérie Class"
 VIC_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Algérie-class heavy cruiser were a further improvement of the previous classes of the Suffren and Duquesne but designed to be the opponent of the new Italian heavy cruisers of the Zara class. Both the main armor belt and underwater protection was considerably increased. Its AA armament was adequate for its time, but due to these changes, the standard displacement was over 10,000 tons."
 VIC_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Saint Louis Class"
 VIC_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Saint Louis-class heavy cruisers were based on the Algérie class but the overall look was closer to that of the Dunkerque and Richelieu class capital ships. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval program, but due to the Fall of France none of them were laid down. They would field new guns and improved AA armament but the armor would be the same as on the Algérie class. It was the last heavy cruiser design of the French Navy."
 VIC_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Forbin Class"
 VIC_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Forbin-class heavy cruisers were a hypothetical design as a follow up of the Saint Louis class. Designed to defend the trade lanes between Mainland France and the colonies, it had long range and good speed along with a heavy armament of guns in four triple turrets and an adequate number of AA weaponry. The ship layout and general look resembled an influence from the previous Saint Louis class as well as British Crown Colony class."
 VIC_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Durand-Viel Design"
 VIC_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Durand-Viel design of battlecruiser was a proposal among a series of studies dating back to WWI. They were essentially the battlecruiser versions of the Normandie and Lyon classes of battleship featuring the same quad turrets and guns though in reduced number. Like contemporary battlecruisers of other navies, they would be faster but less armored than a battleship. They were cancelled before WWI broke out."
 VIC_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Dunkerque Class"
 VIC_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Dunkerques were designed to counter the German Deutschland-class pocket battleships. They were the apex of a series design studies from the mid 1920's to early 1930's. Authorized in the 1931 and 1934 naval programs, they were similar to the British Nelson-class battleships, with all of their main turrets concentrated forward. This resulted in a shorter belt armor and thus a smaller ship to fit into the Naval Treaties limitations."
 VIC_battleship_1:0 "Courbet Class"
 VIC_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Courbet-class battleships were the first super-dreadnoughts built for the French Navy before and during the First World War. Authorized in the 1910 and 1911 naval programs, they saw limited service during World War I, but were active during WW2. Though they had thicker armor and stronger guns than the previous Dante class battleships, they were still inferior to contemporary USN and RN battleships. They displaced just over 22,000 tons and their only modernizations before WW2 were an improved AA armament and improved boilers."
 #VIC_battleship_1b: "Bretagne Class" 
 VIC_battleship_2:0 "Richelieu Class"
 VIC_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Richelieu-class battleships were the last battleships commissioned into the French Navy. They were an improved design of the Dunkerque and authorized under the 1935 and 1938 naval programs. They had excellent AA armament, speed and range, which made it an excellent capital ship. Out of the four ordered, only two were launched and one was completed before the Fall of France. There were numerous attempts to finish the remaining ships using different designs, proposed for use as anti-aircraft battleships, battleship-carrier hybrids, or full scale carriers."
 VIC_battleship_3:0 "Gascogne Class"
 VIC_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Gascogne class of battleships were a subclass of the Richelieu class. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval program but none were started. The design would be a repeat of the Richelieu, but with the main armament distributed evenly fore and aft, improved AA Armament, and improved engines resulting in an overall better ship."
 VIC_battleship_4:0 "Alsace Class"
 VIC_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Alsace-class battleships were planned to succeed the Richelieu class. Four ships were ordered, with the design studies finished in 1939, authorized in 1940, and expected to be laid down in 1941, though the Fall of France prevented this from happening. It improved upon the Richelieu design with heavier and more numerous main guns, stronger AA armament, thicker armor plates, and larger engines."
 VIC_SH_battleship_1:0 "Charlemagne Class"
 VIC_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Charlemagne class of super battleships was a hypothetical design to match the big battleships of other navies. They featured a heavy armament all forward in superfiring positions, heavy AA armament, and thick armor. The entire design borrowed elements from the Richelieu and British Nelson classes."
 VIC_SH_battleship_2:0 "Napoléon Bonaparte Class"
 VIC_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Napoléon Bonaparte-class battleships were a hypothetical design and based on the Alsace and Gascogne classes. Its heavy armament was distributed evenly fore and aft in triple turrets, with superfiring secondaries and heavy AA armament. Thick armor and strong engines provided the speed and defense needed to keep up with the other ships in the fleet and effectively battle its adversaries."
 VIC_carrier_1:0 "Béarn Class"
 VIC_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Béarn was originally laid down as a Normandie-class battleship but later finished as an aircraft carrier, displacing 22,100 tons and serving during the interbellum years and WWII. As a converted carrier, its speed was slow and it had limited space for aircraft, but the medium armor belt and long range made up for these shortcomings. Its construction gave important experience to the French designers in the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale) and led to a series of design studies afterward."
 VIC_carrier_2:0 "Joffre Class"
 VIC_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Joffre-class carriers (Project name PA-16) were the next generation of carriers for the French Navy. It was the last of the design studies that started in 1929 and ended in 1937. Two ships were authorized in the 1938 naval program, but the escalating conflicts slowed down the construction process and eventually the Fall of France prevented the completion of these ships. Displacement would be around 20,000 tons. They would have good AA armament, armor, and speed, but a below-average aircraft complement. Overall, it would have been a well-rounded and versatile carrier for the French Navy."
 VIC_carrier_3:0 "Jean Bart Class"
 VIC_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Jean Bart carrier was a mid-war proposal to convert the unfinished Richelieu class battleship Jean Bart into a full scale carrier in a similar way to the Japanese IJN Shinano. The hull's large size would be resulted in a large aircraft component and together with the big engines a long range and fast carrier. The heavy AA armament of US origin would have provided a good defense against aircraft and smaller surface combatants."
 VIC_carrier_4:0 "Clemenceau Class"
 VIC_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Clemenceau class aircraft carrier (Project name PA-28) were the first postwar carrier design of the French Navy. The design would be similar to the unfinished Joffre class carriers, though the installed equipment and weaponry would be of modern French products. The acquisition of the USN and RN escort carriers and the economical state of postwar France prevented these ships from being laid down. Not to be confused with the latter Clemenceau class aircraft carriers (Project name PA-54), which were laid down in 1955 and 1957."

 YUG_submarine_1:0 "Hrabri Class "
 YUG_submarine_1_desc:0 "The two Hrabri class submarines were originally laid down as British L-class submarines for the Royal Navy, but were sold and ultimately completed for Yugoslavia using a modified design in 1928. They were large submarines, displacing 975 tons surfaced, and were armed with six 533mm torpedo tubes and two four-inch guns."
 #YUG_submarine_2:0 "Osvetnik Class"
 #YUG_submarine_2_desc:0 "The two Osvetnik-class submarines were designed and built in France on the design of the Circe-class submarines. They were somewhat smaller than the preceeding Hrabri-class submarines. Equipped with six 533mm torpedo tubes, they still packed a comparable punch."
 YUG_destroyer_2:0 "Dubrovnik Class "
 YUG_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Dubrovnik was one of the largest destroyers in the world when she was built by the UK for Yugoslavia, displacing 1,880 tons standard.

 #YUG_destroyer_2:0 "Beograd Class"
 #YUG_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Beograd class consisted of three destroyers built with French help. Two of the ships were built at Split, while the third was built in France. All three were based on the French L'Adroit-class destroyers and commissioned in 1939. They displaced 1,210 tons and were armed with four 120mm/43 Skoda guns and six 533mm torpedo tubes. They had excellent speed but below-average range."
 YUG_destroyer_3:0 "Split Class "
 YUG_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Split was a heavy destroyer launched and completed in Yugoslavia. It was launched in 1943 but not completed until 1958, with a modified design. Its original design displaced 2,400 tons and was armed with five 140/56 Skoda guns in its main armament. Despite its size, it had excellent speed."
 YUG_light_cruiser_protected:0 "Dalmacija Class "
 YUG_light_cruiser_protected_desc:0 "Dalmacija was the former German light cruiser Niobe, purchased by Yugoslavia in 1925 and used as a gunnery training ship. Originally launched in 1899 and with a main armament of six 83mm guns, Dalmacija had limited combat value, but remained in service with the Yugoslav and then, after being captured, Italian and German navies, during the war."
