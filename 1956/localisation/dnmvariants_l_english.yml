You'll see historic ship variants (with more historically appropriate capabilites) used by the AI (and have the choice of using them yourself), and the defines have been tweaked to improve naval matters (noting there's only so much that can be done), as well as more admirals for some nations (there'll be more in time) and a small number of flavour events (again, these will be expanded upon).\n\nThis is still an alpha - while the mod is at a stage that it is enjoyable to play as it is, there is much more planned. The next thing on the cards is a more probability-driven technology system (but keep in mind this will take some time).\n\nIn The War at Sea, where it's feasible you'll get a choice as to how you want to play it, which need to be made at the start of each game.

Anti-aircraft defence was provided by one quadruple two-pounder pom-pom and two quadruple Vickers machine gun mounts, although this was improved considerably during the war at the expense of the torpedo armament.\n\nThe ships' powerplants' 48,000 horsepower could drive them at 36 knots, and they retained the relatively long range of the Tribals.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built 24 J/K/N class destroyers, although all of the N class were initially transferred to Allied navies (five to Australia, one to Poland and two to the Netherlands). Like all British destroyers of that time, they saw heavy and varied service, engaging German destroyers and submarines in the North Sea, operating in the Mediterranean, harrying Italian forces in the Red Sea and one went east early in the Pacific campaign, sinking a Japanese submarine before it was mined. They took heavy losses, with 12 of the 16 ships in British service lost in action.  Seven were lost to air attack, two to submarines (including one to submarine gunfire) and three to mines.  \n\nThis was the last 1936 model destroyer built by [Root.GetNameDef]."

Of the RN ships, eight were lost or written off during the war, four to submarines, three to aircraft and one to an S-Boat. Five served with the RN into the 1950s, when four were transferred to Turkey and served in their Navy until the 1970s.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] designed and built five more 1940 destroyer types after this model (but it's worth noting they were all smaller and more lightly armed, although also cheaper than the L/M class)."

The anti-aircraft armament comprised a radar-equipped stabilised Hazemeyer mount for twin 40mm Bofors supported by four single powered two-pounders. Anti-submarine loadout was generally four depth charge throwers and at least 70 depth charges, and torpedo armament was two quadruple 21 inch tubes.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built 16 Z/Ca destroyers, which all commissioned in 1944 and generally saw service in northern waters, supporting offensive carrier sweeps against the coastline or escorting arctic convoys. No ships in the class were lost (although one was seriously damaged by a submarine), and all went on to serve into the 1950s, 60s and 70s (with two each being sold to Israel and Egypt).

The Battle class (1942) were [Root.GetNameDef]'s first destroyer designed to meet this need, and were first laid down in late 1942. Like the previous Z/Ca class, they were armed with four 4.5 inch guns, but this time they were in two dual-purpose mounts with remote power control, linked to a Mark VI director and advanced radar capable of blind-firing against aircraft.\n\nAs well as the substantially greater anti-aircraft capability of the main armament, the class mounted four twin 40mm Bofors guns and six 20mm Oerlikons. Armament was rounded out by eight 21 inch torpedo tubes, four depth charge throwers and 60 depth charges.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built 16 Battle (1942) destroyers, however delays in receiving their directors meant only one (Barfleur) was commissioned in time to see service in the Pacific before the war was over.

Their smaller hulls, however, meant that they had to reduce the torpedo and depth charge armament to compensate for the extra weight, leaving only four 21 inch torpedo tubes, two depth charge throwers and 35 depth charges.\n\nAnti-aircraft armament was also slightly reduced, comprising a twin 40mm mount, two single two-pounders and two 20mm Oerlikons (in single mounts).\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built 24 Ch/Co/Cr destroyers, although four were transferred on completion to Norway and two to Canada.

 shipvariants.85.d:0 "The Swiftsure class were based on the Fiji/Uganda class, but with improved anti-aircraft capability, having five twin 4 inch mounts and four quadruple two pounder pom-poms, supported by twenty-two 20mm Oerlikons. Their main armament was the same as the Uganda class, three triple 6 inch turrets, and torpedo loadout remained six 21 inch tubes.\n\nTop speed was also unchanged, at 32.25 knots, but to make space for the extra anti-aircraft armament, this class carried no aircraft. Armour protection was unchanged, comprised of a belt with a maximum thickness of 3.5 inches, a deck that was 2 inches thick over key areas, and with two inch turret faces (1 inch elsewhere).\n\nIncluding the Tiger sub-class, [Root.GetNameDef] ordered eight and laid down seven Swiftsure class cruisers, but only three were completed to the original design, and only two before the end of the war (one of which was transferred to Canada). The ship that stayed with the RN, Swiftsure, served with the British Pacific Fleet in late 1944 and 1945. After the war, the two British ships that were completed to the original design were scrapped in the early 1960s, two more were cancelled, and the remaining three, after quite a delay, were completed to a different design in 1959-61 (the post-war Tiger class, the last British cruisers to serve with the RN).\n\nThe Swiftsure class were the last 1940 cruiser model built by [Root.GetNameDef]."

 shipvariants.86.t:0 "King George V Class Battleship developed"
 shipvariants.86.d:0 "The King George V Class battleships, laid down in the second half of the 1930s, were constrained by the limits of the Second London Naval Treaty to 35,000 tons displacement and a maximum calibre of 14 inch guns.  Britain settled on a main armament of ten 14 inch guns in two quadruple and one twin turret, with a secondary armament of sixteen dual-purpose 5.25 inch guns and close-in anti-aircraft armament of thirty-two two-pounder pom-poms in four octuple mounts.\n\nArmour on the the class was reasonable given the displacement, with a belt that reached 15 inches in width at its thickest point, a deck that was 6 inches thick over the magazines and 13 inch thick turret faces. Improvements in machinery meant that this class was far faster than previous British battleships, at 28 knots maximum speed.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built five battleships of this class, all seeing heavy service during the war. Probably the most famous was HMS Prince of Wales, whose short but eventful life included landing important hits on the Bismarck in the Battle of the Denmark Strait, to getting sunk by air attack in the disaster off Malaya in December 1941, the only one of the class to be lost in action. Between them, the remaining ships served from the Arctic to the Pacific. They were put into reserve in the late 1940s/early 1950s, and scrapped by the end of that decade.\n\nThe King George V class was the only 1936 battleship model built by [Root.GetNameDef]."

 shipvariants.87.d:0 "The Lion Class battleships were an improved design based on the preceding King George V class, but freed of treaty restrictions.  This allowed a main armament of nine modern 16 inch guns in three triple turrets, with a secondary armament the same as the  King George Vs, of sixteen 5.25 inch guns in eight twin turrets.  Close-in anti-aircraft armament was improved to forty six two-pounder pom-poms in six octuple mounts.\n\nArmour included a belt that reached 15 inches in width at its thickest point, a deck that was 6 inches thick over the magazines and 15 inch thick turret faces. Top speed was improved, to 30 knots.\n\n[Root.GetName] initially planned to build four Lions, but only ordered three and was not able to lay down more than two before other war priorities put them on hold. Work continued on the turrets into 1943, but eventually the ships were broken up on the slips in 1944, as the focus of the battle fleet had by then clearly shifted to aircraft carriers.\n\nDue to their long time under construction, [Root.GetNameDef] developed one more detailed 1940 battleship design, an 'improved Lion'. They also built HMS Vanguard, but this ship is covered by event."

 shipvariants.88.d:0 "Wartime developments and the existence of the partially-built but suspeneded Lion Class battleships lead to substantial alterations to their design over the course of the war. The largest design, built with an eye to defence against airpower in mind, was a 56,500 ton vessel that was armed with improved, faster-firing 16 inch guns in three triple turrets, with armour, speed and anti-air defence significantly upgraded. Armour was increased to an 18 inch belt and a 9 inch deck, maximum speed raised to 31.5 knots, and the close-in anti-aircraft loadout was proposed to be 64 40mm Bofors and 20 20mm Oerlikons.\n\nNot surprisingly, by the time [Root.GetName] had the capacity to resume battleship construction it was clear that the battleship's role in the fleet was diminishing, and these plans were never put into action, the two partially-constructed Lions broken up on the slip in 1944.\n\nThe Lion class (improved) was the last serious battleship design of [Root.GetNameDef] in the Second World War."

 shipvariants.89.d:0 "In March 1939, with geopolitical tensions rising in Europe and the Far East simultaneously, there was concern that even with the Lion class battleships then under construction, the Royal Navy would be at a significant disadvantage in the Far East should conflict there arise in the first half of the 1940s.\n\nTo bolster their capital ship stocks, [Root.GetNameDef] decided to use four modernised twin 15 inch turrets then in storage as the basis of a new battleship, HMS Vanguard, with the rest of the ship built anew (turrets and guns combined could take longer to build than the rest of the ship, so this, in theory, would result in a relatively quickly built battleship). Armour protection consisted of a 14 inch belt (at maximum thickness), 6 inch deck, 13 inch turret faces and improved torpedo protection. Top speed was 30 knots.\n\nAs it turned out, despite having priority for construction after Japan entered the war, HMS Vanguard was not completed until 1946, and had the distinction of being both the last battleship ever constructed, and the only British dreadnought never to go to war. She served into the 1950s, but was mothballed in 1956 and scrapped in 1960."

 shipvariants.90.t:0 "Illustrious Class Carrier developed"
 shipvariants.90.d:0 "The Illustrious class represented a significant shift in design focus from the preceding Ark Royal, as tensions in Europe called for an aircraft carrier for European operations that was better defended against air attack. Displacing 23,000 tons standard, the Illustrious' class had a 640 foot flight deck (later lengthened to 740 foot).\n\nThe hangar underneath was protected by three inches of armour on the top and four and a half inches on the sides, and could carry 33 aircraft (although deck parks and outriggers later in the war increased that amount to 54), the low capacity the price of armour protection. It was defended by sixteen \n4.5 inch dual-purpose guns in eight twin turrets and six octuple two-pounder pom-pom mounts.\n\n[Root.GetName] built three Illustrious class aircraft carriers, which commissioned in 1940 and 1941 and saw heavy war service, from the Arctic to the Pacific and everywhere in between (one, HMS Victorious, temporarily transferred to the Pacific in early 1943 to bolster the Allies' then-dwindling carrier force in the theatre). While there has been some controversy as to the value of the heavily armoured approach, every carrier survived the war despite all taking battle damage (some extensive), and HMS Victorious served until 1968, operating jets after an extensive refit.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built one more design of 1936 aircraft carrier after this class."

 shipvariants.91.d:0 "Based on (and originally part of) the Illustrious class, the Indomitable class had a larger hangar and could carry up to 56 aircraft without resorting to a deck park or outriggers (although the cramped hangars limited the type of aircraft the carrier could operate). Like the Illustrious class, she displaced 23,000 tons standard, but her flight deck was 680 feet long (later lengthened to 745 feet).\n\nThe hangar underneath was protected by three inches of armour on the top, while the ship had a four and a half inch belt, but the hangar side protection was reduced to compensate for the larger hangars. It was defended by sixteen 4.5 inch dual-purpose guns in eight twin turrets, six octuple two-pounder pom-pom mounts and eight 20mm Oerlikons.\n\n[Root.GetName] only built one Indomitable class aircraft carrier, which commissioned in 1941. Like its precessors, it saw heavy war service, first in the Eastern fleet and then in the Mediterranean, before joining the forces in the Far East again. Over her career, she was hit by multiple 500kg bombs and one aerial torpedo, as well as a Kamikaze, but survived the Second World War and served until the early 1950s, being scrapped in 1955.\n\nThe Indomitable class was the last 1936 model carrier built by [Root.GetNameDef]."

It displaced 23,450 tons standard, had a 760 foot long flight deck, and at top speed could make 32 knots.\n\nThe anti-aircraft armament comprised sixteen 4.5 inch dual-purpose guns in eight twin turrets, five octuple and one quadruple two-pounder pom-pom mounts and 35 20mm Oerlikons, although this was increased further during the war.\n\n[Root.GetName] built two Implacable class aircraft carriers, both commissioning in 1944 (they were laid down in 1939, but were temporarily suspended while construction focussed on escort vessels for the Battle of the Atlantic). They initially served in raids on the Norwegian coast (including against the Tirpitz), before transferring to the Pacific Fleet.

They retained (and strengthened, to 4 inches thickness) the armoured hangar roof that also formed part of the flight deck, but they also greatly increased the hangar space and height, making this carrier design much more flexible in terms of the aircraft types it could operate. It was designed to carry 60 modern aircraft in its hangars, with around another 20 in a deck park when appropriate.\n\nThe original planned anti-aircraft armament comprised sixteen 4.5 inch dual-purpose guns in eight twin turrets, eight octuple two-pounder pom-pom mounts and up to sixty 20mm Oerlikons.\n\n[Root.GetName] ordered four Eagle class aircraft carriers, but only two were laid down, not to be completed until well after the end of the war.

 shipvarb.5.d:0 "France's first carrier laid down as such from the keel up, these ships were planned to displace 18,000 tons standard, with a 200 metre flight deck and a complement of 40 aircraft. Anti-aircraft armament was to consist of eight dual-purpose 152.4mm guns in four twin turrets, eight 37mm cannon and twenty-eight 13.2mm machine guns.\n\nInfluenced by contemporary British carrier design, the relatively small air complement was partly a product of a reasonable amount of armour, including a four inch belt and a maximum thickness of 2.75 inches of armour over the main (but not flight) deck.  The designed top speed was 32 knots.\n\n[Root.GetName] laid down one ship of this class, and ordered another (and may have authorised a third) but all work ceased when the Germans invaded France, with what had been completed scrapped later.\n\nThis was the only 1936 model aircraft carrier designed by [Root.GetName]."

The Type IIC was a further refinement of the earlier Type IIB, displacing 286 tons surfaced and armed with three 533mm torpedo tubes (all in the bow), with five torpedoes carried on patrol. The IIC was the first Type II submarine to be constructed with any gun armament, a 20mm cannon for anti-aircraft defence.\n\nThe top speed for a Type IIC on the surface was 12 knots, while they could make 7 knots submerged. While short ranged compared with other German submarines, they were relatively long ranged for submarines of their size.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built 8 submarines of this model, commissioned between November 1938 and January 1940, and only two were lost in action during the war (one in port was decommissioned after air raid damage, while the other was sunk by a combination of depth charges and torpedoes from British destroyers and submarines), the rest being surrendered or scuttled at wars' end.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built one more 1936 submarine design."

 shipvarb.10.d:0 "Very similar to the preceding Type IXA, the IXB was enlarged and modified to increase fuel stowage, increasing its range, while also increasing its displacement to 1034 tons surfaced. In other respects, however, it was similar to it's predecessor, with identical armament (six 533mm torpedo tubes - four in the bow, two in the stern - with 22 carried in total, while guns were a 105mm deck gun and a 37mm and 20mm cannon) and similar speed (18 knots surfaced, a bit over 7 knots submerged).\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built 14 submarines of this model, commissioned between November 1939 and December 1940. They were the most succesful class of U-Boat in terms of merchant shipping sunk, with each vessel sinking an average of over 100,000 tons gross register tons during their careers.\n\nHowever, long service during the Battle of the Atlantic meant all bar one ship didn't survive the war (and even that vessel was scuttled, but later raised by the French), with seven lost to air attack, three depth charged by a surface vessel, one mined and one rammed by the Polish destroyer Wilk. Famously, the British captured U-110, from which they were able to obtain both signal codes and an Enigma machine, before it foundered while under tow.\n\nThis was the last 1936 model submarine built by [Root.GetNameDef]."

They displaced 749 tons surfaced, and had five 533mm torpedo tubes (four bow, one stern) carrying 14 torpedoes in total. Gun armament comrised an 88mm and a 20mm cannon. They were capable of 17 knots surfaced and 7.6 knots submerged.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] commissioned nearly 600 submarines of this model, between March 1940 and July 1944, which served in almost every maritime theatre where Germany was engaged. Most were lost during the war and many of the survivors were scuttled when Germany surrendered, but a handful of VIIC's saw service with the French, Norwegian, Soviet and East German navies in the post-war period.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built eight more 1940 submarine designs."

Like the Japanese Sen-Taka, it was faster submerged (17.2 knots) than surfaced (15.6 knots), but was more modern than the Sen-Taka in other respects. The Type XXI was able to use sonar to target enemy vessels without climbing to periscope depth, and also had radar, a greatly improved hull design and a schnorkel, allowing them to never fully surface (they still needed to recharge batteries at schnorkel depth).\n\nArmament comprised six 533mm torpedo tubes in the bow and either four 20mm or four 30mm anti-aircraft guns (depending on availability of the 30mm). Displacing 1595 tons surfaced, they had a long range and were very quiet underwater.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] planned to build over 1000 Type XXIs, but the war ended before a small proportion of these had been begun. Manufacturing difficulties and crew training requirements both contributed to delays in the vessels becoming operational, so while the first vessel was commissioned in June 1944, only two Type XXI combat patrols (and no attacks on enemy vessels) were made. Post-war, The US, Britain, France and the USSR all tested the Type XXI and it had a strong influence on future submarine designs.

They were intended for the shallow waters of the Mediterranean, the North Sea and the Black Sea, where larger submarines were less practical.  While no boats were lost on war patrols, eight Type XXIIIs were lost prior to deployment. Three survived the war and post-war scuttlings as transfers to Allied navies, the last being struck from the Soviet Navy in 1962. However, West Germany raised two sunken Type XXIIIs in 1956 and they served with the Bundesmarine into the 1960s, influencing later German submarine designs.\n\nThis was the last 1944 submarine produced by [Root.GetNameDef]."

The strong main armament of the preceeding class was unchanged, comprising five 127mm guns and eight 533mm torpedo tubes, while they had five 37mm and seven 20mm cannon for air defence. Anti-submarine weaponry consisted of four depth charge throwers and 18 depth charges. They were very fast destroyers, even for German designs, with a top speed of 40 knots.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] commissioned six destroyers in this class, from August 1938. Five were destroyed at Narvik in 1940 during two battles with British forces, while the sixth, Karl Galster, had the good fortune to be under refit.

The design, however, was beset with problems.  The increased weight of the armament substantially reduced seaworthiness, and the lower rate of fire of the larger weapon actually lead to a decrease in the weight of shells that could be sent downrange over time (although it did lead to a sgnificant increase in penetration).\n\nMost in this class were armed with four 150mm guns, eight 533mm torpedo tubes, four 37mm and five 20mm anti-aircraft cannon, as well as four depth charge throwers and depth charges. Displacing around 2600 tons standard, they were capable of of around 38 knots.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] commissioned eight destroyers in this class, from September 1940. Five were lost during the war, three to surface actions and two to air raids while at port.

This bolstered the main armament to five 150mm guns (a twin turret fore, with three singles aft), improving the ship's hitting power.\n\nOtherwise, this class was very similar to the preceding 1936A destroyers, with the same torpedo (eight 533mm tubes), anti-aircraft (four 37mm and five 20mm cannon) and depth charge (four depth charge throwers) armament.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] commissioned seven destroyers in this class, from April 1942. Only two were lost during the war, one due to a friendly collision with another ship in the class (Z37 was rammed by Z32, causing torpedo warheads to explode) and the other in a surface action while trying to penetrate through to the Normandy landings. Post-war most were scrapped but one each served with the French and Soviet navies into the 1950s.\n\nThis was the last 1936 destroyer design built by [Root.GetNameDef]."

Thus, the vessels were armed with five single 127mm guns, eight 533mm torpedo tubes, four 37mm and fifteen 20mm anti-aircraft cannon and four depth charge throwers (with 30 depth charges).\n\nThese vessels were better handling boats than the 1936As, and retained the 38 knots top speed of earlier 1936 Type destroyers.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] laid down five destroyers in this class but only three were completed as the priority in naval construction shifted to U-Boats later in the war. The first was commissioned in September 1943, but of the three, two (Z35 and Z36) were lost in a friendly minefield. The other, Z43, operated mainly in the Baltic escorting convoys and providing shore bombardment support to the beleaguered Wehrmacht.

Further, the vessels were long-ranged, to allow for commerce raiding.\n\nLaid down in 1936 and completed in 1940 and 1941 respectively, Bismarck and Tirpitz had a significant influence on the naval conflict in the Atlantic and Arctic. Both required the Royal Navy to retain significant forces to counter them. Bismarck, while short-lived, was responsible for the sinking of the Hood before being sunk herself by a combination of Royal Navy forces in the same sortie, in 1941.

 shipvarb.42.d:0 "The Tromp class were far too thinly armoured to contest the larger light cruisers being built by Japan, prompting a new Dutch design, the first ship of which was named Eendracht prior to its post-war redesign. They were to be armed with ten 152mm guns in two triple and two twin turrets, with close-in anti-aircraft armament comprising six twin 40mm Hazemeyer Bofors mountings and four 12.7mm machine guns.  Torpedo armament was six 533mm torpedo tubes.\n\n Displacement was expected to be 8,350 tons standard, and top speed 32 knots. Armour was relatively robust, with the belt reaching 100mm in thickness, the deck 25mm and turret faces 100mm.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] laid down two ships in this class, but both were captured in relatively early states by Germany.  Germany continued construction work, but at a slow pace such that neither were completed before the end of the war, when they reverted back to Dutch control.They were completed by the Netherlands to substantially altered designs, renamed (more than once, such that over their lives both vessels had been at different times named De Ruyter and De Zeven Provinciën!), and served until the mid-1970s when they were sold to Peru. While one was decommissioned in 1999, the other (now named Almirante Grau) received further modernisation and is still in service, the last gun cruiser in any navy.\n\nThis was the only 1940 light cruiser design developed by [Root.GetNameDef]."

While these vessels would not have matched Japan's stronger capital ships, they would have comfortably outmatched Japan's heavy cruisers.\n\nPlanned armour for this class included a belt with a maximum thickness of 225mm, a 100mm deck and 250mm turret faces, while the top speed was expected to be 34 knots.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] planned to build three ships in this class, but they were only authorised in February 1940 and none were laid down before the German invasion and, even if they had been, they would not have been completed before Japan's invasion of the Dutch East Indies.\n\nThis was the only 1936 battlecruiser design developed by [Root.GetNameDef]."

Initially, Aquila was to have been a relatively limited conversion, resembling an escort carrier, but as the war went on and the usefulness of carriers was demonstrated, the design evolved into something closer to a fleet carrier.\n\nDisplacing 23,350 tons standard, capable of 30 knots and with an initial air group of 36 but with the prospect for this being expanded with the use of folding-wing aircraft, Aquila could have been a capable fleet unit. Armament included eight 135mm low-angle guns, twelve 65mm and 132 20mm anti-aircraft guns.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] virtually completed the Aquila but the surrender of Italy in September 1943 prevented her commissioning. Taken over by the Germans, she was damaged in an air raid, and then by human torpedoes, leading the Germans to abandon plans to commission her and scuttle her instead.

The armament for a seaplane-carrying B1 was six 533mm torpedo tubes in the bow (17 torpedoes carried), a 140mm deck gun and two 25mm anti-aircraft guns.\n\nLike many of Japan's long-range submarine, the B1 boats were fast on the surface, with a top speed of 23.6 knots and a cruising speed of 16 knots, but could only make 8 knots underwater. Changes to the conning tower design, however, did improve submerged maneuverability.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built twenty boats in this class, laid down between 1938 and 1941, and commissioned between September 1940 and April 1943. This class was relatively successful earlier in the war. The standout moment was a spread of six torpedoes by I-19 on the 15th of September, 1942, which sunk the aircraft carrier USS Wasp and the destroyer USS O'Brien, and damaged the battleship USS North Carolina. Like the rest of Japan's submarine fleet, however, they suffered extreme losses. Eighteen were sunk during the war, one was wrecked in 1944 and just one survived through to August 1945 to surrender to Allied forces (to be scuttled in 1946).\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] developed nine more 1940 submarine designs."

Ten more boats had been planned but were never laid down. This class, like so many others, suffered heavily at the hands of the Allies, with none surviving past the end of October 1944, nine lost to enemy attack and one foundering during training. Between them, the whole class only managed to sink one US submarine (USS Corvina, the only US submarine lost to a Japanese submarine) and five merchant ships.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] developed eight more 1940 submarine designs."

Stemming from plans by Admiral Yamamoto to launch a raid on the Panama Canal, they could carry three dive-bombers apiece, launched from a single catapult (note that at this stage in the mod's development their aircraft carrying capability is not modelled). They were extremely long ranged, with a nominal endurance of 37,500 nautical miles at 14 knots, around one and a half times the circumference of the planet.\n\nSurface speeds reached 18.7 knots, while they could travel at 6.5 knots submerged.

They had been developed from the experimental No. 71 submarine, which had been commissioned in 1938.\n\nHad these vessels become operational before war's end, they could have given the Allies an unexpected challenge, but the revolutionary nature of the design came with a greater share of teething troubles and training challenges and the boats had a range of issues that were unresolved before the end of hostilities. Accordingly, there was never a chance for them to use their four 533mm torpedo tubes (10 torpedoes carried on patrol) or two 25mm anti-aircraft guns against enemy forces.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] planned to build 98 boats in this class, but only laid down eight, launching six and only commissioning three before the end of the war.

They were, broadly, the corollary of the German Type XXIII boats.\n\nGiven the small displacement of 377 tons surfaced, it's not surprising that armament comprised just two 533mm torpedo tubes (four torpedoes carried on patrol) and a 7.7mm machine gun.\n\nLike the Sen-Taka class, none of these vessels were operational before war's end. They had a schnorkel, and had a theoretical ability to stay submerged for up to 15 days and could have been potentially troublesome if the war had not finished when it did.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] planned to build 90 boats in this class, but only laid down 23 and just 10 were completed ten before the end of the war.

Like most inter-war Japanese destroyers, the anti-submarine loadout was relatively light, with two depth charge throwers and 16 depth charges.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built 18 ships in this class, first laid down in August 1937 and commissioned between November 1939 and July 1941.  Ships from this class participated in most of the major actions in the Pacific and had some success, sinking a number of enemy destroyers and the light cruiser USS Helena. However, only one survived to the armistice to be transferred to China in 1947 as reparations, remaining in service until 1970. Of the 17 lost, most (at least seven) were to air attack, although surface actions, mines and submarine torpedoes also caused losses.\n\nThis was the last 1936 destroyer design developed by [Root.GetNameDef]."

They also had four 610mm torpedo tubes (with a further four reload torpedoes), as well as a close-in anti-aircraft armament of four 25mm guns.\n\nThey were large for a destroyer, displacing 2,701 tons standard, and speed (33 knots) was slower because of this. Anti-submarine loadout was strong, with six depth-charge throwers and 72 depth charges.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] laid down 16 ships in this class and planned 22 more (as well as 16 'enlarged Akizukis') but only 12 were launched and commissioned, between June 1942 and August 1945.

 shipvarb.78.d:0 "The Agano class were intended as replacements for the World War One era cruisers that operated as destroyer leaders, and were designed with high top speed (35 knots) but relatively low protection (56mm belt over the machinery, 18mm deck, 25mm turrets). Main armament comprised six 152mm guns (the same type of 152mm guns used originally on Kongo) and eight 610mm torpedo tubes (with 8 spare torpedoes) carried, unusually for a cruiser, on the the centreline.\n\nThe main guns were only capable of elevating to 55 degrees, limiting their AA capability, with the main anti-aircraft firepower provided by two twin 76.2mm and thirty-two 25mm guns. Displacement was 6,652 tons standard and two aircraft and radar were also carried, as were depth charges.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built four ships in this class, laid down between June 1940 and November 1942 and completed between October 1942 and November 1944.  Three were lost during the war, Agano to a submarine torpedo while limping back to Japan, and Noshiro and Yahagi by carrier aircraft (Yahagi during the suicidal Operation Ten-Go). The last to complete, Sakawa, lacked fuel for operations by the time she was finished and survived the war to be used as a repatriation ship and then was expended in the Bikini Atoll nuclear tests.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] developed one more 1940 light cruiser design."

 shipvarb.79.d:0 "The Oyodo class were intended as submarine flotilla leaders, resulting in a relatively unusual light cruiser design. They retained the same high top speed of the Agano class (35 knots) and light armour (although there was some redistribution with a slightly thinner belt and slightly thicker deck). Main armament comprised two of the Mogami's former triple 155mm gun turrets, superimposed forward leaving the after end of the ship free for facilities for six seaplanes, intended to scout for targets for submarines.\n\nDisplacement was 8,164 tons standard. Unlike other Japanese cruisers, Oyodo had no torpedoes, but a relatively robust anti-aircraft armament, of four twin 100mm guns and twelve 25mm cannon.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built just one ship in this class, laid down in February 1941 and and completed in February 1943 (although another had been planned). Oyodo saw service from Truk to the Philippines to Singapore, taking part in the Battle for Leyte Gulf (assuming the role of flagship after Zuikaku was sunk).

Anti-aircraft armament comprised eight 127mm dual-purpose guns, eight 25mm guns and four 13.2mm machine guns.\n\nDisplacement was planned at 12,200 tons standard, with a designed top speed of 33 knots and longer-than average range.  Armour, however, was relatively light for a heavy cruiser, and they would have been vulnerable in a gun duel with modern American CAs.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] laid down two ships in this class in 1942, but heavy losses to Japan's carrier force at Midway lead to one beginning conversion into an aircraft carrier, and the other (less complete) being broken up to make room in the slip for a dedicated aircraft carrier to be built. The converted ship (Ibuki) was never completed, being cancelled in March 1945 and scrapped in 1947.\n\nThis was the last 1940 heavy cruiser design developed by [Root.GetNameDef]."

Secondary armament comprised sixteen 100mm dual-purpose guns, twelve 25mm guns and eight 13.2mm machine guns, as well as eight 610mm torpedo tubes.\n\nLike the Alaskas which were built to counter them, they would have had relatively limited armour for a vessel of their size, just 190mm of belt, 125mm of deck and 210mm on the turret face, suggesting that a duel between a B-65 and an Alaska would likely have been short and explosive.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] never got beyond the planning stages, with the need for more carriers and other ships leading to continually postponing ordering them until wartime developments had made it no longer feasible.\n\nThis was the only 1940 battlecruiser design developed by [Root.GetNameDef]."

Secondary armament comprised twelve 155mm guns in four triple turrets, while tertiary armament was twelve 127mm dual-purpose guns in six twin turrets. This was supplemented by twenty-four 25mm guns and four 13.2mm machine guns for close-in anti-aircraft defence (more 127mm and 25mm were added during the war).\n\nDespite its massive size, the designed top speed was 27.5 knots. The class were heavily armoured, with a 410mm belt, 230mm deck and 650mm turret faces.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] laid down four ships in this class, between 1937 and 1940, and commissioned two, in December 1941 (Yamato) and August 1942 (Musashi). The third, Shinano, was sunk while undergoing trials after being converted to an aircraft carrier and the fourth was broken up on the slips. A fifth was projected but never ordered. Musashi was sunk by air attack during the Battle of Leyte Gulf, while Yamato survived that encounter but met her end to overwhelming air attack in 1945 during Operation Ten-Go.\n\nThis was the only 1936 battleship design developed by [Root.GetNameDef]."

Secondary armament was to be entirely 100mm anti-aircraft guns, presumably supported by 25mm guns for close-in anti-aircraft defence. However, while the design was 'essentially completed' in 1941, the destruction of documents at the end of the war means limited knowledge of these and other details.\n\nThese ships were expected to displace around 70,000 tons, and have a 460mmm armoured belt (suggesting that deck and turret armour would likely also have been thickened).  Designed top speed has been suggested as 30 knots.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] projected two ships in this class, however neither were named (they were referenced as 'Warship 798' and 'Warship 799') and the carrier losses at Midway shifted Japan's shipbuilding priorities before either could be laid down.\n\nThis was the only 1940 battleship design developed by [Root.GetNameDef]."

Displacing 17,300 tons standard, she had a top speed of a little over 34 knots and armour that at its thickest points was 150mm on the belt and 55mm on the deck (over the magazines, it was considerably thinner elsewhere). Thus, while improved, the level of protection was still limited.\n\nHiryu was able to operate an air group of 64 aircraft, as well as carry nine more in reserve. Her armament comprised twelve 127mm dual-purpose guns and thirty-one 25mm guns for close-in anti-aircraft defence.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] only built one ship in this class, laid down in July 1936 and commissioned in July 1939. She took part in operations against China before being part of the attack on Pearl Harbour and the US expansion across the Pacific.

 shipvarb.85.d:0 "The Shokaku class (as well as their descendant, Taiho) were Japan's most successful carrier designs.  Displacing 25,675 tons standard, they were large for their time, with an air group of 72 aircraft (as well as 12 spares). The vessel's top speed was impressive given its size, of a little over 34 knots, driven by 160,000shp of machinery.\n\nImproving substantially on the Hiryu's design, the maximum thickness of the belt armour was 165mm, and the deck 90mm, although the lack of armour on the flight deck, combined with the enclosed but unprotected hangars, created fire and explosion risks. Armament comprised sixteen 127mm dual-purpose guns, in eight twin turrets, and thirty-six 25mm guns for close-in anti-aircraft defence.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built two ships in this class, laid down in 1937/38 and commissioned in August and September 1941, substantially bolstering the available aircraft for the Pearl Harbour attack. They saw extensive war service after the raid, taking part in the Battle of the Coral Sea and a number of other actions before Shokaku was sunk by submarine torpedoes in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. Zuikaku was also heavily damaged during this encounter, but survived only to be sunk by air attack during the Battle of Leyte Gulf.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] developed four more 1940 carrier designs."

This lead to ships that were far more capable than a CVE, with a respectable air group of 48 operational aircraft plus ten reserves, but that were very fragile for a fleet carrier.\n\nThe origins of the class were clear in its weaknesses, with very limited armour (just a 25mm deck over the machinery spaces), a top speed of 25.5 knots and internal subdivision below warship standards. They did, however, provide Japan with extra flight decks that otherwise would not have been available. Armament comprised twelve 127mm dual-purpose guns and twenty-four 25mm anti-aircraft cannon.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built two ships in this class, laid down in 1939 and commissioned in May and July 1942. They both saw service in the South Pacific, but came to grief at the Battle of the Philippine Sea, where Hiyo was sunk by air attack and Junyo was seriously damaged, and after further damage later that year was laid up for the duration of the war to be scrapped in 1947.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] developed three more 1940 carrier designs."

 shipvarb.87.d:0 "The Shinano was laid down as a Yamato class battleship but, after the Battle of Midway, orders were given to turn the virtually completed hull into an aircraft carrier. Displacing around 65,000 tons standard (making it comfortably the largest aircraft carrier of the period in tonnage), it had a designed top speed of 27 knots and was capable of carrying 120 aircraft if used as a fleet carrier (the statistics used for HoI4). However, the Japanese decided to use Shinano as a resupply ship for the existing fleet carriers, and its active air group was around 50 aircraft.\n\nThe design retained much of the battleship armour, with the belt reaching 400mm around the magazines (although it was only 160mm at other places), the main deck 190mm and the flight deck 76mm. Armament comprised sixteen 127mm guns, 145 25mm guns and twelve 28-tube 120mm anti-aircraft rocket launchers.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] launched just one ship in this class, on the 8th of October 1944, and it was sunk not fully completed on the 29th of November 1944 by four torpedoes from the submarine USS Archerfish.

The armament included new, high-performance 100mm anti-aircraft guns in six twin mounts and seventy-one 25mm anti-aircraft cannon.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built just one ship in this class, laid down in July 1941 and completed in March 1944, although Japan at one point planned to build five more similar vessels. Not long after completing her shake-down, she took part in the Battle of the Philippine Sea and was struck by a torpedo from USS Albacore.

They were smaller, displacing 17,150 tons standard, but still fast, capable of 34 knots. The air group was around 65 aircraft.\n\nAppropriate to their role, the Unryu class ships were only lightly armoured, with protection focussed around the magazine and machinery areas. Armament comprised twelve 127mm dual-purpose guns and between fifty-one and eighty-nine 25mm anti-aircraft cannon. Like the anti-aircraft armament, some other details varied between vessels in the class, reflecting wartime developments and the availability of materials and equipment.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] planned to build 16 of this class, but only six were laid down of which only three were completed (in late 1944). None were used in action, although Unryu did embark aircraft for patrols. She was sunk by torpedoes from USS Redfish in December 1944 off Shanghai. Amagi was sunk by air attack in Kure, Japan, while Katsuragi was damaged during two air raids and never deployed in wartime, although she was sufficiently seaworthy to be used for repatration after the war before being scrapped.\n\nThis was the last 1940 carrier design developed by [Root.GetNameDef]."

 shipvard.13.t:0 "Project 23 battleship developed"
 shipvard.13.d:0 "In the 1930s the Soviet Union carried out a number of battleship design studies and finally settled on Project 23, the Sovetsky Soyuz class. Displacing around 58,000 tons standard, these ships would have been large and powerful, armed with three triple 406mm turrets designed for heavy shells at high velocity. However, there were ongoing and never-resolved questions about the Soviet Union's ability to produce these guns, amongst other elements of the design.\n\nSecondary armament comprised twelve 152mm low-angle guns while anti-aircraft defence was provided by eight 100mmm dual-purpose weapons and thirty-two 37mm cannon. Protection involved an armoured belt with a maximum thickness of 420mm, a main deck of 155mm and turrets with faces of 495mm.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] laid down four ships in this class between July 1938 and July 1940. One was cancelled before war broke out, another suspended, and then in July 1941 the State Defence Committee suspended the building of the remaining two. The hull of Ukraina, at Nikolayev, was captured around 75 per cent complete by Germany and blown up as Axis forces retreated while Sovetsky Soyuz, in Leningrad, was partially cannibalised during the siege and broken up post-war.\n\nThis was the only 1940 battleship design developed by [Root.GetNameDef]."

 shipvard.14.d:0 "The Álava class were a further development of the Churruca class, themselves based on British designs, and displaced around 1,700 tons standard with a top speed of 36 knots. Originally ordered in 1936, the progress of these vessels was interrupted by first the Spanish Civil War and then the Second World War, eventually delaying them by fifteen years.\n\nMain armament was four single 120mm Vickers guns, supported by two triple 533mm torpedo tubes. The anti-aircraft armament highlighted the shift in the Nationalist's foreign policy, comprising two 37mm and three 20mm German anti-aircraft cannon. They also carried two depth charge throwers and one depth charge rack.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built two ships in this class, but the interruptions meant the vessels weren't completed until 1951, by which time they were outclassed by more recent models. That didn't stop Spain persisting with them, and after modernisation in the 1960s both served until they were stricken from Spain's naval list, in 1978 and 1982 respectively.\n\nThis was the only 1936 destroyer design developed by [Root.GetNameDef]."

 shipvard.18.d:0 "Representing a significant shift from the earlier Swedish policy of a fleet of coastal defence ships backed by smaller vessels, the Tre Kronor class were built to form the core of the Swedish Navy. Very capable vessels, they displaced 7,650 tons standard and had a top speed of 33 knots. Impressively, the Tre Kronor were the first vessel in service with fully-automatic, dual-purpose 152mm guns giving them outstanding anti-aircraft performance, although with only one triple turret and one twin turret, they lacked the same amount of surface firepower of many contemporaries.\n\nAs well as their main guns, the ships carried six 533mm torpedo tubes, twenty 40mm and seven 20mm anti-aircraft cannon, had four depth charge racks and could carry and lay up to 120 mines. Protection was provided by a 70mm belt, two 30mm decks and 125mm turret faces.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built two ships in this class, laid down in 1943 and completed in late 1947. Both were modernised in the early 1950s. Tre Kronor was stricken in 1964, but Göta Lejon served with Sweden until 1970, when she was sold to Chile and served with their navy until 1984, before being broken up in 1987.\n\nThis was the only 1940 model light cruiser developed by [Root.GetNameDef]."

The German engineers left Turkey at the outbreak of World War Two, and while the first of the domestic boats was far enough along to be completed in early 1940, the second wasn't commissioned until 1946.

 shipvard.20.d:0 "While designed by the French and using British machinery, two of the three Beograd class destroyers were nonetheless built in Yugoslavia. Relatively small vessels, with a displacement of 1,210 tons standard, they still managed a decent armament of four Skoda 120mm guns in single mounts and two triple 533mm torpedo tubes. Further, with a top speed of 38 knots, they were quick.\n\nAnti-aircraft armament comprised two twin 40mm mounts and two machine guns. They were also fitted with one depth charge rack, and could carry 30 mines.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built two ships in this class, both laid down in 1936, with a third built in France. All three commissioned in 1939. Zagreb was scuttled by two junior officers when Yugoslavia surrendered, while the other two were captured after limited action by Italy and pressed into service for the Regia Marina. Ljubljana, now renamed Lubiana, was lost while serving with the Italians in 1943, while Beograd, now renamed Sebenico, was seized by Germany when Italy surrendered, renamed TA43, and served on escort and minelaying duties until lost, probably to scuttling, in May 1945.\n\nThis was the last 1936 model destroyer built by [Root.GetNameDef]."

 shipvard.21.d:0 "Another French design, Split was an enlarged Dubrovnik, displacing \n2,400 tons standard and heavily influenced by the design of the French \nLe Fantasque class. Like the Beograd class, Split was to have British machinery, which would have given her a top speed of 37 knots.\n\nThe proposed armament for Split was six Skoda 140mm guns, five Bofors 40mm anti-aircraft cannon, four 15mm machine guns and six 533mm torpedo tubes, making her a powerful vessel for her time.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] laid down Split, at a shipyard in the city of Split, in July 1939. She was captured while still under construction by the Italians in April 1941, who decided to complete the vessel, renaming her Spalato, but disruptions meant she was launched but not completed before Italy's surrender.  Taken over but also not completed by Germany, she was scuttled in October 1944 in the face of advancing Yugoslav forces.\n\nHer story does not end there, however. After the war, Yugoslavia raised Split, and restarted construction, and the rapprochement with NATO in 1953 meant that when completed in 1958, it was with British machinery and American armament and fire control, to a substantially modified design.\n\nThis was the only 1940 model destroyer design laid down by [Root.GetNameDef]."

Generally well-designed, their main shortcoming was a large fairwater, which was modified during the war to reduce the silhouette.\n\nArmament comprised eight 21-inch torpedo tubes, four in both the bow and stern, with 24 torpedoes carried on patrol. This was supplemented by a 3-inch deck gun (to be replaced by a 4-inch gun during the war) and two .50 calibre machine guns. Thirty-two mines could be carried in lieu of torpedoes.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built six boats in this class, laid down in 1936 and completed 1937-38. All were part of the Asiatic fleet in late 1941 and saw heavy war service from the beginning, most undertaking more than ten war patrols and one, Stingray (pictured), completing 16.

Displacing 1,450 tons surfaced, they had a top speed of 20 knots above water and 8.75 knots under. The Sargo class saw the introduction of a new battery casing which made the batteries more resilient to damage while being depth-charged. Like the Salmons, they also had a large fairwater when built, which was trimmed during wartime to reduce the silhouette.\n\nArmament was identical to the preceding Salmon class, comprising eight 21-inch torpedo tubes, four in both the bow and stern, with 24 torpedoes carried on patrol. This was supplemented by a 3-inch deck gun (to be replaced by a 4-inch gun during the war) and two .50 calibre machine guns. Thirty-two mines could be carried in lieu of torpedoes.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built ten boats in this class, laid down in 1937 and 1938 and completed in 1939. Four were lost during the war, two to Japanese depth charge attacks, one to Japanese air attack, and one, Seawolf, to a suspected friendly fire incident. A fifth, Squalus, sunk on trials and was the subject of a complex rescue and salvage operation which saw her renamed as Sailfish and carry out twelve war patrols. Like the Salmons, all saw heavy service from the start of the war in the Pacific, and the survivors were stricken in the second half of the 1940s.\n\nThis was the last 1936 model submarine built by [Root.GetNameDef]."

Key improvements over previous submarines included faster diving times, an enlargedd conning tower that included the sonar operator and torpedo data computer and a stealthier periscope.\n\nArmament was also improved, with the number of bow tubes increased to six (stern tubes remained at four), with a patrol load of 24 torpedoes. This was supplemented by a 3-inch deck gun (to be replaced by a 4-inch gun during the war) or, on specially-reinforced members of the class, a 5-inch/51 calibre weapon, and two .50 calibre machine guns. Forty mines and four torpedoes could be carried as an alternative loadout.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built 12 boats in this class, laid down in 1939 and 1940 and completed in 1940 and 1941.

Displacing a bit over 900 tons surfaced, they had a top speed of 16 or so knots above water and 11 knots below, driven by new designs of engines (which were different in each boat). Range was far shorter than the larger fleet submarines.\n\nArmament comprised six 21 inch torpedo tubes (four bow, two stern, 12 torpedoes carried on patrol), a 3-inch gun and two .50 calibre machine guns.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built two boats in this class, laid down in 1939 and 1940 and completed in 1941. Further development of smaller submarines was wound back as it had become feasible to produce large numbers of fleet boats and the need for coastal defence submarines never materialised.

 shipvard.26.d:0 "Continuing the US focus on long-range fleet submarines, the Gato class saw a significant increase in size, displacing 1,825 tons surfaced. This saw the hull lengthened for greater stability, the engine room divided into two compartments separated by a bulkhead (providing greater resilience to damage) and an increase in the electronic equipment installed.\n\nSpeed was similar to earlier fleet submarines, of a little over 20 knots above water and 8.75 knots below. Armament also remained similar, with ten 21-inch torpedo tubes (6 bow, 4 stern, 24 torpedoes total) supplemented by a 3-inch deck gun (to be replaced by a 5-inch gun during the war) and two .50 calibre machine guns. Forty mines and four torpedoes could be carried as an alternative loadout.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built 73 boats in this class, laid down between September 1940 and May 1943 and completed between December 1941 and \nMarch 1944. They saw heavy war service and 20 were lost to various causes. Notable achievements by the class include the sinking of the Japanese carriers Taiho and Shokaku, and the rescue of the future US President George Bush. USS Flasher sunk more tonnage than any other submarine in the war, 100,231 tons.\n\nDespite being outclassed by more modern US types at war's end, many found alternative roles such as radar pickets and trainers, and the last operational boats in US service were decommissioned in 1969.

The key improvement was the use of high-tensile steel and a thicker hull to achieve an increase in diving depth to 400 feet.\n\nArmament remained similar, with ten 21-inch torpedo tubes (6 bow, 4 stern, 24 torpedoes total), but the deck gun was either four or five inches in calibre when constructed (compared with three-inch guns on earlier submarines). Later boats in the class were built with 20mm or 40mm anti-aircraft cannon, and those earlier boats built with two .50 calibre machine guns had them replaced. Forty mines and four torpedoes could be carried as an alternative loadout.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built 120 boats in this class (the largest in USN history), laid down between March 1942 and July 1944, and completed between February 1943 and September 1948. Those completed in time for war service saw substantial action, including the sinking of the Shinano by Archerfish (the largest vessel sunk by submarine). USS Tang sunk 33 ships, totalling 116,454 tons, a US submarine record.\n\nNine were lost during the war, while two more were lost to post-war accidents.

This flexibility helped make possible the installation of the Mark 37 fire-control director and its below-decks computer arrangements.\n\nThe Mark 37 was far and away the best medium-battery anti-aircraft fire control during the war, and its use for the dual-purpose main battery on US destroyers gave them substantially better anti-aircraft capability than comparable vessels in other navies.\n\nMain armament (as finished once overweight issues had been resolved) comprised five 5-inch guns and two quadruple 21-inch torpedo tubes. Light anti-aircraft armament was four 0.50 calibre machine guns, although this was expanded later with one 5-inch gun removed to compensate for the extra weight.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built twelve ships in this class, laid down in 1937-38 and completed in 1939-40. Five were lost during the war, three to submarines, one to air attack and one in a surface action. The survivors were all out of service by the end of the 1940s, with four being used during the nuclear bomb tests at Bikini Atoll.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built two more 1940 model destroyers."

 shipvard.31.t:0 "Benson class destroyer developed"
 shipvard.31.d:0 "Continuing from the Sims class, the Benson destroyers saw another important introduction, that of splitting the machinery into two separate compartments (a unit or staggered arrangement), making the ship far less likely to be disabled by a single hit. This saw an increase in displacement to 1838 or 1911 tons (the class involved two alternative machinery arrangements) and a top speed of 35 knots.\n\nMain armament originally comprised five dual-purpose 5-inch guns, two quintuple torpedo tubes and six 0.50 calibre machine guns. The anti-submarine armament, however, was very light, at just ten depth charges on two racks. Wartime saw many variations in armament, with a main gun and/or set of torpedo tubes removed for more anti-aircraft or anti-submarine capability (with later ships in the class having changes made during construction).\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] originally planned to build 24 ships in this class as the 1938, 1939 and 1940 destroyer programs. However, the deteriorating global situation war saw a further 68 ordered to maintain the momentum in destroyer construction while the Fletcher class were developed. Sixteen were lost in action, primarily to air attack (six) and surface actions (five). Most were placed in reserve shortly after the end of the war, and all were out of active service by the mid-1950s, to be scrapped in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built one more 1940 model destroyer."

 shipvard.32.t:0 "Fletcher class destroyer developed"
 shipvard.32.d:0 "The outbreak of the war in Europe released the US from remaining treaty restrictions, which saw marked changes in US destroyer design. The Fletcher class was larger (2,325 tons standard), had a flush-decked design and its 60,000 SHP powerplant gave it a trial speed of 38 knots.\n\nArmament as originally designed comprised five dual-purpose 5-inch guns in single mounts, two quintuple torpedo tubes, one quadruple 1.1 inch anti-aircraft cannon and four 0.50 calibre machine guns. Wartime experience, however, saw the close-range anti-aircraft armament improved substantially, with multiple 40mm Bofors and 20mm Oerlikons. They also came with an improved anti-submarine armament, of six depth charge throwers, two racks and 56 depth charges.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] commissioned 175 ships in this class between 1942 and 1944, with the first ships laid down in April 1941. They saw heavy wartime service, mostly in the Pacific, and suffered 18 sunk in action to a range of causes, with Kamikaze attacks sinking seven and damaging a further 26 very badly, in many cases beyond repair.\n\nThey were placed in reserve after the end of the Second World War, but many were reactivated for the Korean conflict. The last in the class were stricken from the USN in the mid-1970s but many were sold to other nations, the last Fletcher class retiring from Mexico's navy in 2001. Four remain as museum ships in the US, one (Kidd, in Louisiana) in it's World War Two configuration.\n\nThis was the last 1940 model destroyer built by [Root.GetNameDef]."

 shipvard.33.d:0 "The Allen M Sumner class were an attempt to pack more firepower on US destroyers by mounting three twin dual-purpose 5-inch mountings, with remote power control. Squeezing this into a hull the same length and only one foot and two inches wider than a Fletcher made them cramped ships that were wet forward, but they were nonetheless a successful and powerful design.\n\nStandard displacement was 2,610 tons and the increase in weight, while retaining the same 60,000 shaft horsepower as the Fletchers, saw a reduction in speed to a designed 36.5 knots and generally less than this in practice.\n\nAs well as the main guns, armament comprised ten 21-inch torpedo tubes, twelve 40mmm and eleven 20mm anti-aircraft cannon and the same strong anti-submarine loadout as the Fletchers.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built 70 vessels in this class, although twelve were completed as minelayers, exchanging their torpedo tubes for 120 mines. The first wasn't completed until the end of 1943, after the Japanese were in retreat, but they still saw significant service, mostly in the Pacific. Four ships in the class were lost in action, one to a mine off the Normandy beachhead, one in a surface action and two to kamikazes.\n\nThe class saw continued service with the USN into the 1970s, after which a number were sold to foreign navies. One, USS Laffey, remains as a museum ship in South Carolina.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built one more 1944 model destroyer."

Armament was identical to the Sumners as built, with three twin, dual-purpose 5-inch mounts, ten 21-inch torpedo tubes, twelve 40mmm and eleven 20mm anti-aircraft cannon (as well as the same anti-submarine loadout).\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built 98 vessels in this class, although only 45 were completed before the end of the war and even those only saw limited action. There were no war losses but they saw considerable service post-war, with some serving in the USN into the 1980s (albeit with substantial modernisations).\n\nLike other US destroyers, many were sold to foreign navies after their USN service and some Gearings continued to serve into the 2000s abroad, the last ending its service with Mexico's navy in 2014.

 shipvard.36.d:0 "The outbreak of the war in Europe freed the US from the 8,000 ton treaty restriction, resulting in the much larger Clevelands. The need for cruisers quickly led to a design based on that of the St Louis class, but with an increase in beam and a reduction in main armament to facilitate greater anti-aircraft firepower.\n\nMain armament comprised four triple 6-inch turrets, supported by six twin 5-inch dual-purpose mounts, four twin 40mm and thirteen 20mm anti-aircraft cannon. Displacement was around 11,700 tons standard, of which 1,468 tons were armour, providing a belt with a maximum thickness of 5 inches, a 2 inch deck and 6.5 inch turret faces. Top speed was \n32.5 knots.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] planned to build 39 ships in this class (not counting the Fargo sub-class), laid down from June 1940, but nine were completed as light carrier conversions and three were cancelled (two prior to being laid down). Of the remaining 27, 25 were completed before the end of World War Two and saw heavy service, mainly in the Pacific but also in the European theatre.\n\nAll survived (although a number were damaged), but stability issues contributed to them being decommissioned in the 1950s. Six, however, were rebuilt as guided missile cruisers and served into the 1970s.

The first four ships were also unusually fitted with sonar and two depth-charge racks. Protection comprised a belt that was 3.75 inches at its thickest, as well as 1.25 inches of armour on the deck and turret faces.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] built 11 ships in this class, eight laid down between 1940 and 1942, and three towards the end of the war to an improved design (not completed until after the end of hostilities). The four earliest ships in particular saw heavy war service, two being lost at the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal.\n\nThe remaining six original vessels survived the war to be placed in reserve in the late 1940s, along with two of the later ships.

In and out of reserve over the next fifty years, members of the class took part in the Korean War, the Vietnam War and the first Gulf War. All were stricken between 1999 and 2011, to become museum ships across the United States.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] developed one more 1940 model battleship design."

 shipvard.47.t:0 "Montana class battleship developed"
 shipvard.47.d:0 "While powerful ships, the Iowas were not armoured sufficiently to protect themselves from their own guns (often one of the elements of battleship design). The Montanas were meant to remedy this, but protection against 2700lb shells required substantially more armour, increasing displacement to 60,500 tons standard. With a focus was on firepower and protection, the Montana's design had less horsepower and a slower top speed (28 knots) than the Iowas.\n\nMain armament would have comprised four triple 16-inch turrets mounting the same 50 calibre gun as the Iowas, supported by ten improved twin 5-inch dual-purpose turrets, thirty-two quadruple 40mm and twenty 20mm anti-aircraft cannon.\n\nPlanned armour comprised a belt that was 17.1 inches at its thickest, a 7.35 inch deck and 22.5 inch turret faces.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] authorised five ships in this class in July 1940, but none had been laid down when they were suspended at Presidential direction in April 1942, due to steel shortages. All were cancelled in July 1943.\n\nThis was the last 1940 model battleship design developed by [Root.GetNameDef]."

 shipvard.48.t:0 "Wasp class carrier developed"
 shipvard.48.d:0 "A product of the interwar naval treaties, USS Wasp was designed around a limit of just 15,000 tons standard (she displaced 14.700 tons standard when launched). This, combined with the US emphasis on aircraft capacity at the expense of other features, lead to a compromised design. She did have the distinction, though, of being the first carrier fitted with a rudimentary deck-edge elevator.\n\nTop speed was a relatively slow 29.5 knots and while there was a provision for vertical armour to be fitted in the design, but this never happened, and horizontal armour was just 1.25 inches. Critically, the vessel lacked any form of torpedo protection.\n\nWasp was, however, capable of carrying a large air group for her size, around 80 aircraft. Defensive armament comprised eight 5-inch dual-purpose guns, sixteen 1.1 inch anti-aircraft cannon and twenty-four 0.5 inch calibre machine guns, although the machine guns  were replaced by 20mm Oerlikons during the war.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] only ever intended to build one ship in this class, laid down in 1936 and commissioned in 1940. USS Wasp initially served in the Atlantic, helping ferry vital aircraft reinforcements to Malta, before transferring to the Pacific in support of the Guadalcanal campaign.  It was here she was struck by three torpedoes from the Japanese submarine I19 and sunk, in September 1942.\n\nThis was the last 1936 model carrier developed by [Root.GetNameDef]."

 shipvard.49.t:0 "Essex class carrier developed"
 shipvard.49.d:0 "With the lapsing of treaty restrictions the US was free to design a significantly larger carrier, with the Essexes initially displacing 27,200 tons standard although still inheriting many design elements from the Yorktown class.\n\nThey were fast (32.7 knots), had respectable amounts of armour (a 4 inch belt and 3 inch hangar deck), improved torpedo protection and extensive internal subdivision. Most importantly, they had extensive aircraft facilities, with a large hangar, full deck-edge lift and substantial storage for fuel and ammunition, allowing the planned capacity of 91 aircraft to occasionally exceed 100 in wartime conditions.\n\nDefensive armament was also much improved, with four twin and four single dual-purpose 5-inch mounts and numerous 40mm and 20mm anti-aircraft cannon (the amount varied by vessel and over time).\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] ordered 32 ships in this class, the first laid down in April 1941. Twenty-four were completed, with eight cancelled when it became clear they wouldn't be necessary. The Essex class formed the backbone of the US task forces that fought their way across the Pacific, with the class providing the bulk of the overwhelming airpower available to the USN from the second half of 1943 onwards.\n\nNone were lost in action (although some were very heavily damaged) and the class gave good service well into the Cold War, the last (USS Lexington) decommissioned in 1991 after many years as a training carrier. Four remain as museum ships in the US.\n\nThis was the only 1940 model carrier developed by [Root.GetNameDef]."

 shipvard.50.t:0 "Midway class carrier developed"
 shipvard.50.d:0 "Influenced by the capacity of British carriers with armoured hangars to survive heavy bomb damage, the US designed a carrier with the speed of an Essex but with substantially greater size to accommodate both an armoured flight deck and increased vertical armour, and the stability issues these entailed. The final vessel thus displaced over 47,000 tons standard, by far the largest carrier built during the period. The increased armour included a \n2 inch main deck, 2 inch hangar deck and 3.5 inch flight deck, as well as a belt 8 inches at its thickest.\n\nThe Midway's large size enabled an unparalleled air wing, of 137 aircraft, with fuel and stores to support them. Defensive armament comprised sixteen single dual-purpose 5-inch/54 calibre guns and varying numbers of 40mm and 20mm anti-aircraft cannon.\n\n[Root.GetNameDef] ordered six ships in this class, but only three were laid down in late 1943 and 1944, completing in 1945 and 1946, too late for involvement in the Second World War. They were also not deployed to Korea, but (after modernisation) all three made combat deployments to Vietnam. USS Franklin D Roosevelt was stricken in the second half of the 1970s, but Reagan's naval expansion saw Midway and Coral Sea receive extensive refits carrying them into the early 1990s with the last, Midway, seeing a combat deployment in the First Gulf War before decommissioning in April 1992 (she is now a museum ship in San Diego).\n\nThis was the only 1944 model carrier developed by [Root.GetNameDef]."
