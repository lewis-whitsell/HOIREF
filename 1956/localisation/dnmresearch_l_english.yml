 NAVAL_TITLE_AA_TECHNOLOGY:0 "ANTI-AIR SYSTEMS"
 Interwar_AA_tech:0 "Interwar AA"
 Interwar_AA_tech_desc:0 "While navies had started adding anti-aircraft guns to their ships before the end of the First World War, many navies expanded their investments in naval AA during the 1920s, developing medium-calibre, rapid-firing weapons designed primarily to engage aircraft."
 Late_1930s_AA_tech:0 "Pre-war AA"
 Late_1930s_AA_tech_desc:0 "As aircraft continued to develop, navies in turn refined their AA systems (although the outbreak of war would see that they were insufficient to the task), with higher-velocity, multi-barreled systems, and early anti-air fire control systems."
 Early_War_AA_tech:0 "Wartime AA expansion"
 Early_War_AA_tech_desc:0 "Wartime experience highlighted the need for greater AA installations on existing and new vessels to counter the threat posed by aircraft."
 Late_War_AA_tech:0 "Advanced AA systems"
 Late_War_AA_tech_desc:0 "Improved fire control and powered training and elevation, combined with innovations including ammunition with proximity fuses, greatly improved the effectiveness of naval AA systems."
 NAVAL_TITLE_RADAR_TECHNOLOGY:0 "SEABORNE RADAR"
 Surface_search_radar:0 "Surface Search Radar"
 Surface_search_radar_desc:0 "The early radar sets were bulky, and required a lot of power, so were only practically able to be installed on larger vessels.  They proved valuable in aiding ships' tactical awareness, particularly in low visibility situations."
 air_warning_radar:0 "Air Warning Radar"
 air_warning_radar_desc:0 "As radar sets were refined, they were employed to provide early warning of air attack. In effect, this enabled vessels to be ready for the aircraft and put up a stronger air defence."
 advanced_surface_search_radar:0 "Advanced Surface Search Radar"
 advanced_surface_search_radar_desc:0 "The development of centimetric radar allowed the installation of far more powerful but also far smaller radar sets.  This meant larger vessels had even more tactical awareness, and smaller vessels were able to employ radar as well."
 surface_fc_radar:0 "Surface Fire Control Radar"
 surface_fc_radar_desc:0 "It wasn't long before radar was being used to assist with fire control and ranging, making larger warships more effective at range and at night."
 advanced_fc_radar:0 "Anti-Air Fire Control Radar"
 advanced_fc_radar_desc:0 "Further improvements in radar led to them aiding in target acquisition for ships' anti-aircraft weapons, enabling significantly more accurate AA fire against incoming aircraft."
 NAVAL_TITLE_ASW_TECHNOLOGY:0 "ANTI-SUBMARINE WARFARE"
 early_sonar:0 "Early Sonar"
 early_sonar_desc:0 "Developed at the end of the first-world war, and initially known as ASDIC, sonar was thought at the time to have likely rendered submarines ineffective in future wars.  While this was a drastic overestimate of sonar's capabilities, these early sets were still useful in enabling surface vessels to combat submerged enemies."
 depth_charge_throwers:0 "Depth Charge Throwers"
 depth_charge_throwers_desc:0 "The main weapon against submarines in the inter-war period and for most of the Second World War was the depth charge.  Depth charges could be rolled off the stern of a ship onto the expected location of a sub, but the development of depth charge throwers enabled vessels to project patterns of depth charges over a wider area, increasing their effectiveness."
 basic_sonar:0 "Basic Sonar"
 basic_sonar_desc:0 "Using sound to detect vessels underwater was (and is) a complex science, and sonar systems advanced on numerous occasions between the end of the First and the Second World Wars"
 asw_mortars:0 "Anti-Submarine Mortars"
 asw_mortars_desc:0 "A key shortcoming of sonar was that contact was lost when the attacking ship travelled over the target, giving the submarine a window within which it could maneuver to evade the coming depth charge attack.  The invention of anti-submarine mortars such as Hedgehog and Mousetrap allowed escorts to fire at targets in front of them, and were an important addition to anti-submarine warfare."
 advanced_sonar:0 "Advanced Sonar"
 advanced_sonar_desc:0 "Representing the most advanced sonar developed during the period, these sets are better at finding submerged raiders, and are important to counter ever-improving submarine design."
 NAVAL_TITLE_TORPEDO_TECHNOLOGY:0 "TORPEDOES"
 interwar_torpedoes:0 "Interwar Torpedoes"
 interwar_torpedoes_desc:0 "Torpedoes continued to develop after the first world war, and most of the major nations in WW2 used torpedoes designed and first put into service in the 1920s and early 1930s"
 magnetic_detonators:0 "Magnetic Detonators"
 magnetic_detonators_desc:0 "While initially quite unreliable, once they had been refined magnetic detonators made torpedoes more effective."
 electric_torpedoes:0 "Electric Torpedoes"
 electric_torpedoes_desc:0 "Quieter and leaving far less wake (making it harder for the target to see the incoming danger), electric torpedoes were another significant step forward in torpedo technology."
 advanced_torpedoes:0 "Advanced Torpedoes"
 advanced_torpedoes_desc:0 "Improvements in reliability, aiming (including rudimentary homing devices) and other areas made the torpedoes coming into service at the end of the war very dangerous indeed."
