Chief Justice John Roberts oversaw the ceremony as according to Article Two, Section 1, Clause 8 and the 20th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n\nThe official theme of the inauguration was 'Uniquely American.' In his speech, the President reminded onlookers his promise of an America First foreign policy, and reiterated his intent to 'Make America Great Again' and to reunify a country that is looking more divided than ever. The inauguration coincided with worldwide protests, with dissenters in Washington D.C. smashing windows and rolling trash cans into the street to remind America that support for this new president is far from universal."

Clinton, having conceded the election on November 9th, declined to call for a recount. Despite President-elect Trump's attempt to file legal motions to block the recounts, several other states were subject to recounts separate from Stein's efforts. These included Nevada, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Florida. Despite minor discrepancies, all states certified their original November 8th election results. \n\nWhile Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by over three million votes, Trump carried enough swing states to net him a total of 301 electoral votes to Clinton's 227. As expected, Trump lost the Democratic strongholds of the West and upper East Coast, but won the American South, Midwest, and surprisingly Pennsylvania."

After a tight race, Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton pushed for a recount on the grounds that unspecified "anomalies" may have affected the election's outcome. \n\nAccording to the recount results, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by over four million votes, one million more than last reported. This was enough to carry enough swing states to net Hillary a total of 301 electoral votes to Trump's 227. As expected, Trump lost the Democratic strongholds of the West and upper East Coast, but won the American South. Pennsylvania and the American Midwest, while Red in the original count, turned blue after the latest findings."

In 2016, local and provincial party organizations began electing delegates to the congress as well as receiving and amending party documents. During the congress, a new guiding ideology, labelled Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, was written into the party's constitution. It marked the first time since Mao Zedong Thought that a living party leader has enshrined into the party constitution an ideology named after himself. The Congress also emphasized strengthening socialism with Chinese characteristics, party-building, and socialist rule of law, and setting concrete timelines for achieving development goals, such as building a moderately prosperous society and achieving "socialist modernization"."

 Yemen.4.d:0 "With the country in ruin, the Yemeni Civil War has finally concluded, granting victory to the Hadi-led government, backed by the Saudi Coalition. In the final days of the conflict, coalition forces managed to capture and destroy Houthi and Al-Qaeda ammo dumps, including the infamous Burkan 2-H scud missles. Though many may still hold their loyalties to the Houthis, they have been disarmed, and in the coming days, the remaining Zaydi radicals will be rooted out and dealt with. Democracy has prevailed in the region with the help of the Saudi coalition and it's campaign, Restoring Hope, and the country of Yemen is on it's way to being rebult."
 Yemen.4.d2:0 "With the Hadi-led government reduced to rubble, the Houthi cause has found itself at the forefront of Yemen's future leadership. As was their goal, the Houthi's have managed to drive salafism and devotion to western ideologies from the region, and those who fought for it, as the Al-Qaeda and coalition forces lie in ruin. Now with the full responsibilty of leading Yemen into the future, the Houthi government has begun the process of transforming from it's interrim state, and they have now embarked on the path of rebuilding the country. The Saudi coalition has withdrawn from the region, and has rendered Operation Restoring Hope, a complete and utter failure."
 Yemen.4.d3:0 "After years of fighting between the Yemeni government and the Houthi rebels, the most unlikely of all victors has emerged from the conflict. The remnants of Al-Qaeda in Yemen have found themselves as the architect of a new caliphate in the region, and have undergone a transformation for the future that will put all infidels in the region in danger. The Saudi coalition and Operation Restoring Hope has been a complete failure, and it's incompetence has failed to predict it's own defeat to an enemy it never new was this serious. The jihadis have prevailed, and they have made it clear that this is only the beginning, and the rest of the world will soon realise what this new caliphate can do."

 Saleh.1.t:0 "The Houthi Power Struggle"
 Saleh.1.d:0 "The unlikely alliance between the Houthi rebels and Ali Abdullah Saleh's General People's Congress, has been on shaky ground since the day it was concieved. With help from our coalition members operating inside Yemen, we've discovered that former President Saleh has a growing discontent for the Houthi leadership, and rightly so. The Houthis oppose being effectively controlled by foreign powers, and seek to restore Yemen as it's own, completely independent entity free of salafism and western ideals. Saleh on the other hand, wants to restore Yemen as a free, united and democratic country, eager to participate in foreign affairs to an extent, though he does have his reasons to resent a number of western nations. This relationship is bound to boil over into a future conflict between the two parties, and it may be what the coalition needs."
 Saleh.1.a:0 "We don't have time for this..."
 Saleh.1.b:0 "Get President Saleh on the phone..." 
 
 Saleh.2.t:0 "Saleh Suggests Coalition Dialogue"
 Saleh.2.d:0 "Ali Abdullah Saleh, the head of the General People's Congress aligned with the Houthi cause, is suggesting that the GPC and Houthi leadership open up talks with the Saudi-led coalition currently operating alongside President Hadi's Yemen. Though we very narrowly consider him an ally, it appears he has had a change of heart, and not in a good way. He now sternly suggests that the Houthi leadership come to a decision on whether or not this brutal civil war should continue. The likelihood of us coming out of these talks with something to gain is very small, and it could all very well be a ploy to remove us from power."
 Saleh.2.a:0 "Absolutely not!"
 Saleh.2.b:0 "It couldn't hurt..."
 
 Saleh.3.t:0 "Houthi Leaders are Willing to Talk"
 Saleh.3.d:0 "After pressure from the former Yemeni President, Ali Abdullah Saleh, the leaders of the Houthi insurgents in Sana'a are willing to try to come to terms with Hadi and our coalition."
 Saleh.3.a:0 "Well then, gather the coalition."
 Saleh.3.b:0 "This probably isn't a good idea..."
 
 Saleh.5.t:0 "Saleh Embarks on a Dangerous Path"
 Saleh.5.d:0 "After years of an indecisive and unstable alliance between Houthi and Republican forces, former Yemeni President, Ali Abdullah Saleh, held a speech directed at the Saudi-led coalition highlighting the so-called stupidity of the Houthi cause. Saleh stated that if the coalition were to lift their blockade and open the airports to ease the humanitarian effort, him and his republican forces were willing to pledge their allegiance to Saudi Arabia, declaring himself an enemy of our alliance. Saleh appeared fully committed in his most recent speech, and publically declared a new chapter in Yemen's history amidst this humanitarian crisis, as a united, free and democratic Yemen. The words of Saleh - I am going to fight the enemies of humanity and the enemies of our homeland who are trying hard to erase its identity and destroy its gains and humiliate the Yemenis!"
 Saleh.5.a:0 "Find this traitor..."
 Saleh.5.b:0 "He doesn't have the guts to do it..."
 
 Saleh.6.t:0 "Saleh is On The Run"
 Saleh.6.d:0 "After giving a series of treacherous speeches, Ali Abdullah Saleh has made it clear he no longer wishes to work alongside the Houthis. Abdul-Malik Al-Houthi knew of Saleh's approaching treachery, and he issued several warnings to him, all of which were not heeded. Abdul-Malik Al-Houthi declared this as a treasonous act, which subsequently led to Saleh's home in Sana'a being destroyed by Houthi mortar fire, and he is now fleeing the country. Houthi fighters have been hot on his trail, and they've managed to drive him into a potentially fatal trap south of Sana'a, where combat between the Houthi's and the coalition still rages. A number of fighters manning the front are prepared to pull back and intervene on your command."
 Saleh.6.a:0 "Pull the trigger..."
 Saleh.6.b:0 "Let him go..."
 
 Saleh.7.t:0 "The Supreme Political Council"
 Saleh.7.d:0 "With the war won, the time has come to rebuild our country that we fought so desperately to free from it's misguided leadership. Our associates from the Supreme Revolutionary Committee, an interim government that we had put in place amidst the civil war, remind us of their contribution to the war effort and urge us to carry out our original plan of dividing our presidential council equally between both parties. Let us remember that a number of these men were among those we started this fight against, and those we could not maintain a stable alliance with. We cannot forsee the future, but allowing them a seat in our parliament may very well lead us back into the uncertainty we sought to destroy."
 Saleh.7.a:0 "We fought to achieve this position, and we will fight to defend it"
 Saleh.7.b:0 "Nonsense, we will rebuild our nation together"
 
 Saleh.8.t:0 "Houthi Leadership Denies Saleh's Suggestion"
 Saleh.8.d:0 "After our talk with former Yemeni president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, he made an effort to convince the Houthi leadership to come to a conclusion on whether or not this war of theirs should continue. As we expected, he was rejected without a second thought. The Houthis appear to be beyond adamant on the topic of continuing their war effort to overthrow the democratic government of Yemen. This has worn on on the alliance between Saleh's General People's Congress and the Houthi rebels, and if we push Saleh harder, he may be willing to finally severe ties with the misguided cause."
 Saleh.8.a:0 "We must try harder!"
 Saleh.8.b:0 "Forget it..."
 
 Saleh.9.t:0 "Saleh Persists"
 Saleh.9.d:0 "Ali Abdullah Saleh once again, suggests that we open up talks with the Saudi-led coalition, who I must remind you, is our enemy. It is true that our alliance with the GPC has always been in a critical state, but this persistence by Saleh has not appeared out of thin air, he must have a motive. It would not be crazy to believe that the Saudi-led coalition is in contact with him, we must watch this closely."
 Saleh.9.a:0 "This might actually be a good idea..."
 Saleh.9.b:0 "Ali, stop this immediately, or else"
 Saleh.9.c:0 "Mr. Saleh, may I have a word with you?"
 
 HOU_Saleh.1:0 "Ali Abdullah Saleh will be pursued by Houthi fighters."
 HOU_Saleh.2:0 "Ali Abdullah Saleh will be contacted about bringing the Yemeni Civil War to an end, with our help. Whether that be through diplomacy or brute force, we must convince him to attend a dialogue with our coalition."
 HOU_Saleh.3:0 "Our alliance has never been as strong as would be ideal, but I do value our allegiance, though it may not seem this way. I understand that you want a conclusion to this war, but unfortunately I cannot allow myself or my comrades to deal with this devil of a coalition. Surely you understand?"
 HOU_Saleh.4:0 "Ali is disappointed."
 HOU_Saleh.5:0 "Ali will be contacted once more."
 HOU_Saleh.6:0 "Ali visibly recoils, and exits the room."
 HOU_Saleh.7:0 "Ali will be contacted again, but let this be the final warning to him that if he remains aligned with our enemy, he too will be treated as an enemy."
 
 Saleh.10.t:0 "Saleh is Wasting Our Time..."
 Saleh.10.d:0 "Once again, the leader of the General People's Congress aligned with the Houthi rebels,  Ali Abdullah Saleh, was denied by the Houthi leadership to commence peace talks with our coalition. It has been clear from the beginning that the Houthi leadership will not speak with us, as they see us as a sworn enemy. With the GPC-Houthi alliance as critical as it is, we must deliver Ali Abdullah Saleh an ultimatum immediately. Without him, the Houthis governing parties will be in shambles without proper skill and talent behind it. With him, the leadership has competence, though it lacks a certain ability when it comes to progress, but it could potentially carry the Houthis to victory."
 Saleh.10.a:0 "He either takes action, or we cannot guarantee his safety."
 Saleh.10.b:0 "This is pointless..."
 
 Saleh.11.t:0 "The General People's Congress Defects!"
 Saleh.11.d:0 "Even after numerous occasions in which Saleh's Republican forces have exchanged fire with ours, we've formally remained allies. No longer, these traitors have officially declared themselves as our enemy after their treasonous leader, Ali Abdullah Saleh, was rightfully disposed of. The GPC and it's troops are actively engaging in firefights with us in the streets of our cities, we must put a stop to this at once."
 Saleh.11.a:0 "Traitors! I should have seen this coming!"
 
 Saleh.12.t:0 "Former Yemeni President, Ali Abdullah Saleh Assassinated!"
 Saleh.12.d:0 "This day is considered a major victory for the Houthi cause, as the man who sought to tear them apart from the inside, has now been defeated. It was long believed by the Houthis that Saleh had been in contact with the Saudi-led coalition, but it wasn't until recently that Mr. Saleh had shown his true colors to the Houthis, and attempted to side with the coalition by declaring a new chapter of unification and democracy in Yemen. This struck a great ire in the Houthis, and with Saleh gone, they claim that their morale is soaring."
 Saleh.12.a:0 "Good work boys."
 Saleh.12.b:0 "This is troubling..."
 Saleh.12.c:0 "Interesting."
 
 Saleh.13.t:0 "Saleh Renews GPC-Houthi Alliance"
 Saleh.13.d:0 "The leader of the General People's Congress, a long-time Houthi ally, though not on the greatest of terms, has declared a renewal of the once divided alliance. Ali Abdullah Saleh publically announced a new chapter in Yemen's future, a chapter in which the GPC and Houthis will work together to restore the ruined nation. Saleh gave one condition, and that was that the Houthi leadership formalizes the Supreme Political Council, an interrim government put in place in the time of war, and split the rulership between the two alliances, as was originally planned."
 Saleh.13.a:0 "Is this good? I can't tell."
 Saleh.13.b:0 "Damn!"
 
 Saleh.14.t:0 "The Coalition Gathers"
 Saleh.14.d:0 "The Houthi leadership opposing the democratic, Hadi-led government in Yemen, has shown that they are willing to come to the table and talk about the humanitarian situation currently ongoing in Yemen. Saudi Arabia, the leader of the coalition operating in Yemen, has invited all of it's members to a diplomatic summit being held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The special guests will be Abdul-Malik Al-Houthi himself, along with his associate, Ali Abdullah Saleh."
 Saleh.14.a:0 "We must attend."
 Saleh.14.b:0 "Sorry, we don't have time for this."
 Saleh.14.c:0 "We would be honoured to host this summit."
 
 Saleh.15.t:0 "The Summit Commences"
 Saleh.15.d:0 "Those that chose to attend that summit take their seats, and await the beginning of the discussion. The Houthis have mentioned that they are not coming into this discussion with the intent to just surrender, so we must sway them to see the conflict from an outsider's shoes. This war in Yemen has been one of the greatest humanitrian crises in recent memory, and it would benefit all parties for the war to be put to a halt as soon as possible. To make this quick, let us share our demands..."
 Saleh.15.a:0 "Surrender and return all territories to Yemen's rightful government."
 Saleh.15.b:0 "Cease the conflict immediately, and both states shall remain independent."
 Saleh.15.c:0 "All Houthi claimed land shall be declared an Arabian state."
 
 Saleh.16.t:0 "The Coalition Demands Surrender"
 Saleh.16.d:0 "We were invited to this summit in Abu Dhabi to discuss a potential end to the war we have been fighting for years now, and we have come to the realization that this was all a waste of time. We were immediately greeted by an absurd demand as soon as the summit had started, that demand being our full surrender. But, as long as the war still rages, people will continue to die and cities will continue to be destroyed. Ending the war may be for the better, but it would mean capitulating to our sworn enemies."
 Saleh.16.a:0 "This war must end, so we must oblige."
 Saleh.16.b:0 "Ridiculous! This discussion ends now!"

This greatly upset the non-secular leadership of Al-Shabaab.\n\nDespite being driven to near defeat in 2017, the Islamist group managed to bounce back and gather support from various smaller Islamist and tribal factions, many of which were displeased with the Western-backed secular government. The Black Standard now flies over Mogadishu, and the Al-Shabaab are free to continue spreading radical Islam"

 ### PKK AND KURD EVENTS ###
 
 kurd_rally.1.t:0 "Kurdish Demonstrators Push for Autonomy"
 kurd_rally.1.d:0 "Today we are witnessing something that the Turkish people are all too familiar with, daring Kurdish persistence. This is not something that is new to the republic, nor is it new for those who are illegally taking to the streets to demonstrate their support for a fictional nation that so desperately wants it's independence. Let us not forget that the Kurds have a history of lashing out in an attempt to achieve their goals, but they have never succeeded and will continue fail,  as they will continue to be united as one nation under the true flag of the Republic of Turkey.\n\nIf history tells us anything, this is not the last that we have seen of these rallies as they are likely to continue. We must watch this closely to be sure this activism is not sponsored by any international groups, or the infamous insurgent groups located right here on our own soil. Let it be known to them that testing our patience and restraint is unwise."
 kurd_rally.1.a:0 "Let them protest, they will achieve nothing."
 kurd_rally_tt.1:0 "Kurdish rallies are being held in Diyarbakir, one of the largest centers of population in Turkish Kurdistan. It is likely that these rallies will be ongoing for days or perhaps even weeks, potentially causing a ripple effect encouraging more Kurds to show their support for the cause."
 
 kurd_rally.2.t:0 "Kurdish Activism Continues"
 kurd_rally.2.d:0 "With no surprise to anyone who calls themself a Turk, the recently active Kurdish demonstrators have appeared to have planted their feet in the ground to vigorously push their agenda of setting up an autonomous region of Turkish Kurdistan. However, the push for a completely free and independent nation created and operated by Turkish Kurds is still alive and well. In fact if these demonstrators were to achieve their goal of autonomy, it would likely not be enough for them for as long as a Kurd lives within the bounds of the Turkish Republic, he or she will always strive to rob the republic of what is rightly it's own.\n\nThe rippling effect of these demonstrations is sure to continue, as is our efforts to contain the situation. These Kurds should count themselves lucky as their continuous push for illegal seccession has been met with fire and fury in the past, but in response to the traitorous actions of the radicals they will surely develop into."
 kurd_rally.2.a:0 "Their words fall on deaf ears. They have never achieved anything, nor will they now."
 kurd_rally.2.b:0 "Put an end to these illegal rallies, whatever it takes."
 kurd_rally_tt.2:0 "The support for an autonomous or perhaps even fully independent Kurdistan will continue to grow if nothing is done to curb the already illegal demonstrations."
 kurd_rally_tt.3:0 "Turkish police will attempt to choke down the Kurdish rallies by increasing active personnel and using non-lethal force."
 
 kurd_rally.3.t:0 "Kurdish Revolutionaries Face Suppression"
 kurd_rally.3.d:0 "For too long have we allowed these Kurdish radicals the right to protest in our streets and unlike the revolutianaries before them, they have been given the privilege of a lifetime, the chance to express their grievances. In the past, radical Kurdish activists claimed that they were being "opressed" by the Turkish government when in fact they were attempting to rip a piece of the republic away from us. The government did not stand for this and rightly so, then all of which who showed any cultural affiliation to this fictional nation were silenced, as they never had and never will have the permission to tear our nation apart.\n\nIn cities where the protests are occuring, security forces have increased the number of personnel manning the streets and have began equipping their units with crowd control gear. Security units are now employing the use of non-lethal weaponry and tear gas to convince the demonstrators that they need to clear the streets. The goal is to clear the streets without being forced to handle the situation via violence, but Kurds are unpredictable and we must do whatever we can to prevent the spread of their fantasy messages."
 kurd_rally.3.a:0 "Good, remind them that their ideas are not welcome here."
 kurd_rally_tt.4:0 "As stated, the Kurdish are unpredictable and our actions could again lead to what we have been fighting against for years, Kurdish persistence and resilience. There is no telling what this situation will develop into from here."
 
 pkk_attack.1.t:0 "Armed Terrorists Ambush Security Forces"
 pkk_attack.1.d:0 "Amidst the recent Kurdish activism, suspicion grows that the attack that struck security forces this morning was carried out by a group of Kurdish terrorists, potentially the infamous Kurdish Worker's Party, or the PKK. This as of now, is an unconfirmed suspicion but the idea should remain a point of interest, given that the PKK is no stranger to showing it's support for their fellow Kurds through violent attacks. The attack itself happened quickly and appeared to be thouroughly planned by the terrorists as their targeting and haste showed a level of deliberation, according to a security unit who was on the scene during the shootout. \n\nReports claim that two trucks and what appeared to be eight men stopped on a major overpass that bridges over a main highway that security forces often use to exit the downtown area. Gunfire aimed at two security trucks quickly erupted from the overpass killing at least three security forces and injuring one. Another casualty was reported as the gunmen on the overpass hurled an explosive toward one of the trucks, destroying the vehicle and bursting it into flames."
 pkk_attack.1.a:0 "Launch an investigation and find these terrorists."
 
 pkk_attack.2.t:0 "Security Forces Discover PKK Terror Plot"
 pkk_attack.2.d:0 "As we expected, the Kurds had more up their sleeves than their simple portests that we so graciously allowed them to express for the first time in many years. Security forces uncovered a terror plot orhcestrated by PKK terror cells to ambush a convoy that regularly rolls under an overpass through a populated area in order to reach the outer city. It appears as if all members of the planned attack have been apprehended, but we must always remain on our toes, especially when dealing with the Kurds."
 pkk_attack.2.a:0 "We must investigate this further!"
 
 kurd_riot.1.t:0 "Kurdish Protests Develop Into Riots"
 kurd_riot.1.d:0 "Turkish patriotism is a wonderful thing, though many seem as if they want to divide our nation whether it be from the inside or out. Thanks to our patriots, our glorious nation lives on and will continue to live on through the hearts and minds of the Turkish people regardless of party, regardless of any international pressure. We once again find ourselves facing a resilient pressure not from the outside, but the inside. The recent Kurdish protests have developed into violent riots and the persistence of the Kurdish activists has turned into exactly what we thought it might, a vigorous campaign to tear apart our nation and divide the Turkish people. \n\nThe streets are packed with rioters and looters, destroying their own cities and further creating a rift between us and them. What can we do? We will not sit here and allow our nation to be divided by these terrorists and we will not allow them to continue this campaign of hatred towards Turkish people. We must put an end to this nonsense!"
 kurd_riot.1.a:0 "Stop this at once!"
