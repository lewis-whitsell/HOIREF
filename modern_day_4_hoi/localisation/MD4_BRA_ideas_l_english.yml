 brazilian_knack:0 "The Brazilian Jeitinho"
 brazilian_knack_desc:0 "Jeitinho or "knack" is more than finding a way to accomplish something by circumventing rules or social conventions. Some people see it as a typically Brazilian method of social navigation where an individual can use emotional resources, blackmail, family ties, promises, rewards or money to obtain favors or to get an advantage. But people forget to mention that this expression also comes from the necessity associated to a lack of resources and help. Most Brazilians have to be creative and invent new simpler ways to do things they need, as living. The word "jeitinho" comes from the expression dar um jeito, literally "to find a way". It implies the use of resources at hand, as well as personal connections, and creativity."
